User: Explain how you leverage audience data to build out targeted digital marketing campaigns. 

Bot: To leverage audience data effectively for targeted digital marketing campaigns, our approach involves understanding the demographics and psychographics of the target audience. We segment the audience based on these factors to create distinct student personas. By using tools like Google Keyword Planner and Facebook's audience builder, we can identify and target the most relevant audiences for each campaign. Additionally, by analyzing prior campaign data and measuring the impact per channel, we can make informed decisions on future placements and recommendations. This data-driven approach allows us to tailor our messaging, calls to action, and media placement to align with each audience's position in the decision-making funnel, ultimately increasing the effectiveness of our digital marketing campaigns.
