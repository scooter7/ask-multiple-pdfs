User: Explain how you leverage audience data to build out targeted digital marketing campaigns. 

Bot: To leverage audience data for building targeted digital marketing campaigns, we use a combination of demographics and psychographics to create student personas specific to each institution. This involves clustering the demographics of the current audience and conducting interactive sessions to understand the personality traits and preferences of the students. By using tools like Google Keyword Planner and Facebook's audience builder, we can identify and target the most relevant audiences for each campaign. Additionally, if there are prior campaign data available, we analyze the impact per channel and provide recommendations for future placements. This data-driven approach helps us tailor the messaging, calls to action, and content to align with each audience's position in the decision-making funnel, driving better engagement and conversions.
