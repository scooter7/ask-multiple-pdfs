User: Explain how you leverage audience data to build out targeted digital marketing campaigns. 

Bot: To leverage audience data for targeted digital marketing campaigns, we start by creating student personas based on demographics and psychographics specific to each institution. We then use tools like Google Keyword Planner and Facebook's audience builder to identify and target the most relevant audiences for each campaign. By clustering demographics and conducting interactive sessions with students, we gain insights that inform our strategy. We also analyze the impact per channel from prior campaigns if available, providing recommendations for future placement. This data-driven approach helps us tailor our outreach tactics, messaging, and calls to action to align with each audience's position in the decision-making funnel, ultimately driving conversions effectively.
