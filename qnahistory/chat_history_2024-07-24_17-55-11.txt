User: Explain how you leverage audience data to build out targeted digital marketing campaigns. 

Bot: To leverage audience data for targeted digital marketing campaigns, we utilize various tools like Google Keyword Planner and Facebook's audience builder to identify and target the most relevant audiences for each campaign. By clustering the demographics of your institution's current audience and creating student personas based on demographics and psychographics, we can tailor the messaging and strategy to resonate with specific segments. Additionally, we analyze the impact per channel from prior campaigns to make data-driven decisions and recommendations for future placements. This approach ensures that our campaigns are finely tuned to reach the right audience with the right message at the right time, maximizing effectiveness and ROI.
