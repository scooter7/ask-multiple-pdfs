User: Explain how you leverage audience data to build out targeted digital marketing campaigns. 

Bot: To leverage audience data for targeted digital marketing campaigns, our approach involves segmenting the audience based on demographics and psychographics. This segmentation helps us create distinct student personas that are specific to each institution. By using tools such as Google Keyword Planner and Facebook's audience builder, we can identify and target the most relevant audiences for each campaign. Additionally, we analyze the demographics of the institution's current audience and conduct interactive sessions to understand their personalities and preferences better. By doing so, we can tailor the messaging, calls to action, and content to align with each audience segment's position in the decision-making funnel. This personalized approach allows us to reach prospective students effectively and drive conversions based on the data collected and analyzed.
