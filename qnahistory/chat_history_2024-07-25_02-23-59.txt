User: Explain how you leverage audience data to build out targeted digital marketing campaigns. 

Bot: To leverage audience data for targeted digital marketing campaigns, we first segment the audience based on demographics and psychographics. This segmentation helps us understand the nuances of reaching prospective students by identifying the most relevant audiences for each campaign. We utilize tools like Google Keyword Planner and Facebook's audience builder to pinpoint these audiences accurately. Additionally, we analyze past campaign performance data to understand the impact per channel and make recommendations for future placements. By closely examining the target markets and geographies, we can outline the best blend of digital and traditional media based on the goals and budget of the campaign. This data-driven approach allows us to create personalized and effective digital marketing strategies that resonate with the audience and drive results.
