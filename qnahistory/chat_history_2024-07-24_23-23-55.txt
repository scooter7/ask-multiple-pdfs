User: Explain how you leverage audience data to build out targeted digital marketing campaigns. 

Bot: To leverage audience data for targeted digital marketing campaigns, our approach involves understanding the demographics and psychographics of the target audience. We segment the audience based on their characteristics and behaviors, creating distinct student personas. This segmentation allows us to tailor messaging and calls to action to each audience segment's position in the decision-making funnel. By using tools like Google Keyword Planner and Facebook's audience builder, we identify and target the most relevant audiences for each campaign. Additionally, we use data tracking technologies to collect information tied to key performance indicators (KPIs). This data is then used to create live reporting dashboards on platforms like Tableau, Slemma, and Google Data Studio. These dashboards provide real-time insights into campaign performance, allowing for analysis, insights, and adjustments based on the data collected. Our goal is to ensure that the digital marketing campaigns are effectively reaching and engaging with the target audience for maximum impact.
