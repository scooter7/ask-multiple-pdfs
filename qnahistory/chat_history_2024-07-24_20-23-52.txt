User: Explain how you leverage audience data to build out targeted digital marketing campaigns. 

Bot: Audience data is leveraged to build targeted digital marketing campaigns by first segmenting the audience based on demographics and psychographics, creating distinct student personas. This segmentation helps in understanding the nuances of reaching prospective students, aligning messaging and calls to action with each audience's position in the decision-making funnel. By using tools like Google Keyword Planner and Facebook's audience builder, relevant audiences for each campaign are identified and targeted. Additionally, tracking technologies are selected to collect data tied to key performance indicators (KPIs), which is then used in live reporting dashboards for campaign analysis and insights. Overall, leveraging audience data allows for highly targeted and effective digital marketing campaigns tailored to specific audience segments.
