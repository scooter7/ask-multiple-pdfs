Bot: To leverage audience data for targeted digital marketing campaigns, our strategy involves understanding student personas through demographics and psychographics. This information helps us identify the most relevant audiences for each campaign. We use tools like Google Keyword Planner and Facebook's audience builder to target these specific groups effectively. Additionally, we analyze the demographics of the institution's current audience and conduct interactive sessions to gain in-depth insights into their personalities. By utilizing this data, we can tailor our messaging, calls to action, and content to resonate with the audience, ultimately driving better campaign performance and ROI.
