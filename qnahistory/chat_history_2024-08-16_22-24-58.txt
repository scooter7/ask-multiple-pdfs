User: What is your experience with crm and lead tracking integration

Bot: Based on the provided context, our company has extensive experience with CRM and lead tracking integrations. We work with various CRMs such as Salesforce, Slate, Ellucian Recruit, and Hubspot. We use automation tools like Zapier to integrate campaigns running lead generation advertising on social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn directly into these CRMs. Our staff members are trained experts in setting up these integrations at the beginning of campaigns to ensure quality leads are generated and connected in a timely manner. Additionally, for clients using our proprietary tool, Carnegie Clarityâ„¢, we offer direct integration into Salesforce for web attribution and custom website interactions. So, we have a proven history of providing strategic planning and buying services with superior knowledge in researching audiences and media vehicles/contacts, negotiating rates, handling media invoicing, auditing, and bill paying.
