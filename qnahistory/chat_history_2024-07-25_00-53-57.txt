User: Explain how you leverage audience data to build out targeted digital marketing campaigns. 

Bot: To leverage audience data for targeted digital marketing campaigns, we first segment the audience based on demographics and psychographics. This segmentation helps us understand the different personas within the audience. We then use tools like Google Keyword Planner and Facebook's audience builder to identify and target the most relevant audiences for each campaign. By analyzing the data collected, we can create personalized messaging and calls to action that resonate with each audience segment, ultimately improving the effectiveness of the digital marketing campaigns. Additionally, we use live reporting dashboards and data visualization platforms to track campaign performance and make data-driven decisions for optimization.
