User: Explain how you leverage audience data to build out targeted digital marketing campaigns. 

Bot: To leverage audience data for targeted digital marketing campaigns, our approach involves segmenting the audience based on demographics and psychographics. We use tools like Google Keyword Planner and Facebook's audience builder to identify and target the most relevant audiences for each campaign. By creating distinct student personas specific to each institution, we ensure that the messaging and tactics resonate with the audience. Additionally, we analyze the impact per channel of prior campaigns, sharing insights and recommendations for future placements. This data-driven approach allows us to tailor our outreach tactics to generate top-of-funnel leads, retarget effectively, and use search to complement each stage in the decision-making funnel. The data collected is then used to create live reporting dashboards, providing real-time insights and performance analysis to optimize campaign results.
