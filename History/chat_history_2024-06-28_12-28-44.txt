User: when i get a new laptop, what do i do with my old one?

Bot: When you get a new laptop, there are a few options for what you can do with your old one:

1. **Keep it as a backup**: You can keep your old laptop as a backup in case something happens to your new one. This can be helpful in case of emergencies.

2. **Donate or recycle**: If your old laptop is still in working condition, you can donate it to a charity, school, or organization in need. If it's no longer working or very old, you can recycle it at an electronic waste recycling center.

3. **Sell or trade it in**: You can also sell your old laptop online or trade it in for credit towards your new purchase. Just make sure to wipe all your personal data before doing so.

Remember to also transfer any important files or data from your old laptop to your new one before parting ways with it.
