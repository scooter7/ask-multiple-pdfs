User: Hi! I'd like to view our org chart 

Bot: To view our org chart, you can access it through Insperity OrgPlus. From the left navigation menu, select 'Organizational Planning'. The chart will appear and either show your own information or the results from the last chart you created. You can use features like the search bar to find a specific person and expand your view using options like Chain of Command or Sub-Charts. If you encounter any issues with the chart or your reporting line, you can reach out to HR for assistance.
