User: where can I find the Employee Change Form?

Bot: The Employee Change Form can be submitted if there are changes regarding your direct report, such as becoming a manager, job title change, manager change, department/team change, or a change in the employee's weekly capacity. The form should be sent to hr@carnegiehighered.com for review.
