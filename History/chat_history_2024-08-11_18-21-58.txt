User: vacation time policy

Bot: Carnegie's vacation policy is an Unlimited Vacation plan, which means there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The plan is set up to allow employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet their needs without the stress of a capped number of days. Employees are encouraged to use at least 10-15 days per year for vacation, staycation, relaxation, personal, religious, family needs, etc.
