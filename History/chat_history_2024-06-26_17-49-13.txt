User: how do I request time off?

Bot: To request time off using the TimeStar system, you can log in via computer or the mobile app. Here's how to do it on the mobile app:
1. Tap the three horizontal lines in the upper left corner to reveal the menu.
2. Select ‘Time Off’ from the menu.
3. Tap the orange ‘Request Time Off’ button.
4. Select the orange circular button with a white ‘+’ on it to add a date to the request.
5. Input the exact number of hours and choose the dates that you’d like to request those hours off.
6. From the ‘Pay Type’ dropdown list, choose the relevant reason for your time off.
7. Select ‘Done’ in the upper right corner.
8. Review your timesheet and click ‘Employee Approve’.

Remember, it's recommended to submit your request at least two weeks in advance, but last-minute requests can also be accommodated.
