User: how much PTO do I have?

Bot: Carnegie's PTO plan is uncapped, meaning there is no specific limit on the number of paid time off days you can take each year. The policy allows employees to take time off that is reasonable and respectful, as long as it is productive and meets their needs. It is recommended that employees take at least 10-15 days off per year, but there is no hard and fast rule. For more specific information on your PTO balance, it would be best to refer to the PTO Policy info sheet or the company's handbook, or you can also inquire with your manager.
