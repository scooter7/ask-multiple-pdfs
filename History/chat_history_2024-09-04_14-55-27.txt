User: What is carnegie's policy on expectations of childcare for employees?

Bot: Carnegie offers support for working parents through their Parental Leave Policy, which provides opportunities for recovery and bonding. The policy includes all parents, including adopting parents and caregivers, and runs concurrently with other state or federally protected leaves. Additionally, there is provision for lactation breaks and bereavement leave for pregnancy loss. For more specific details, it is recommended to refer to Carnegie's Employee Handbook.
