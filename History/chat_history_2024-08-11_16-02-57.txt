User: vacation policy

Bot: The vacation policy at Carnegie is an Unlimited Vacation plan, meaning there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The goal is to allow employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet their needs without the stress of a capped number of days. Managers will consider factors like deadlines, projects, client needs, and team coverage when approving requests, but timely, reasonable, respectful requests are likely to be accepted. Summer Fridays are also a continued benefit, and employees are encouraged to use at least 10-15 days of vacation per year. If you have any concerns or are unsure about requesting time off, you can talk to your manager or contact HR for support.
