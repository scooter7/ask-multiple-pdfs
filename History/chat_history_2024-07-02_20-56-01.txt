User: referral

Bot: To refer someone to Carnegie, you can fill out an internal referral form. By completing this form, you are representing that you have a relationship with the person you are referring and are acting as a personal and professional reference. The Talent Acquisition team will then contact you to discuss the person you referred and their capabilities as they relate to the available positions. If your referral is hired and works with the company for six months, you will receive a payout of $2,000. Just make sure you are still employed with Carnegie to receive the referral reward.
