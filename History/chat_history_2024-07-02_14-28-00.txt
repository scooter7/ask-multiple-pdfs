User: what is the ai ethics statement?

Bot: I don't have specific information on the AI ethics statement in the context provided. It seems to focus more on reporting protocols, inclusive language, and workplace resources. If you need information on AI ethics, I recommend checking directly with the organization or referring to their official documentation.
