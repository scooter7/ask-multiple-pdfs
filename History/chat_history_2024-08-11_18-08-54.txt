Bot: The company has an Unlimited Vacation policy, which means there is no cap on the number of paid time off days you can take each year. It is encouraged that employees use at least 10-15 days per year for vacation, relaxation, and personal needs. The TimeStar system is used to request time off, and it is recommended to submit requests with at least two weeks' notice.
