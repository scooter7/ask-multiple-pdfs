User: How much time do I get off?

Bot: The company policy does not have an official cap on the amount of time off you can take. However, it is encouraged that employees use at least 10-15 days off per year. The historical Carnegie time-off schedule suggests 18-28 days, but ultimately, the amount of time off you take should be based on your individual needs and discussions with your manager.
