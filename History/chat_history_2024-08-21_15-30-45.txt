Bot: Yes, it is okay to take vacation days even if you have taken sick days. The company encourages employees to take paid time off for vacation, relaxation, and rejuvenation, in addition to using sick days for unexpected illness or caring for a sick family member. Taking time off for vacation is important for your well-being and productivity.
