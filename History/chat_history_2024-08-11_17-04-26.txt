User: vacation policies

Bot: Carnegie's vacation policy is an Unlimited Vacation plan, which means there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The plan allows employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet their needs without the stress of a capped number of days. If you have any specific questions or need more details, you can refer to the handbook or contact your HR department.
