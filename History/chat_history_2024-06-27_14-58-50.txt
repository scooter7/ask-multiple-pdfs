User: where can i find information on summer fridays?

Bot: You can find information on Summer Fridays in Carnegie's policies and resources, specifically in the Unlimited Vacation plan details. It outlines eligibility, scheduling, and how to request time off for Summer Fridays. You can also check with your supervisor or HR for more specific information.
