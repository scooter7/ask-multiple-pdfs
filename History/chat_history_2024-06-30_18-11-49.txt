User: what is Carnegie's PTO policy?

Bot: Carnegie's PTO policy consists of two components: Unlimited Vacation and Sick Time. The Unlimited Vacation policy allows employees to take time off without a cap on paid days each year for reasonable, respectful, and productive reasons. The Sick Time program provides 40 hours per year, or as required by state law, for unexpected time off due to illness or caring for a sick family member. Additionally, Carnegie offers 8 PTO hours per calendar year for volunteering and encourages sustainability efforts. For more detailed information, employees can refer to the PTO Policy Info Sheet and the company handbook.
