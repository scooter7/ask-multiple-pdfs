User: where can I find the Employee Change Form?

Bot: To find the Employee Change Form, you should contact HR at hr@carnegiehighered.com as they are responsible for handling forms related to employee changes. They will provide you with the necessary form for submitting any changes about your direct reports like becoming a manager, job title change, manager change, department/team change, or changes to the employee's weekly capacity.
