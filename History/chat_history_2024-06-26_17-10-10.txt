User: how many days off do i get?

Bot: There is no official cap on the number of days off you can take. However, it is encouraged for employees to use at least 10-15 days off per year. It ultimately depends on your needs and what makes sense for you, your role, and your success. It is recommended to speak to your manager for guidance on the amount of time off that would be appropriate for you.
