User: How do I take leave

Bot: To take leave, you need to submit a Parental Leave Notification Form to Human Resources at least 30 days prior to your intended leave. If you are a birth mother, the Business Office will submit your leave request. Use Insperity's time and attendance module and select the pay code "Parental Leave" to request parental leave. For other types of time off, such as vacation, sick leave, bereavement, jury duty, or volunteer time, you can use the TimeStar system to log in and submit your request with at least two weeks' notice. Make sure to select the correct reason for your time off from the available options in the system. If you have specific questions about state disability programs or paid family leave benefits, Human Resources can provide additional information on whether you qualify.
