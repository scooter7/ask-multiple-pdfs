User: Do we have any policies around voting or Election Day

Bot: Yes, there is a policy for Voting Leave mentioned in the list of benefits provided by Carnegie. Employees may have the opportunity to take time off to vote. It would be best to refer to the specific details in the Employee Handbook or connect with HR for more information on how this policy is implemented.
