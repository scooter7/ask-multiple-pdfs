User: how best to recruit adult students?

Bot: When recruiting adult students, it is important to have a targeted approach based on demographic and psychographic characteristics that would be a good fit for the school. Segmenting messaging accordingly and using data ownership and transparency can be beneficial. Additionally, clear calls to action on the website, like Request for Information (RFI) forms, on academic program pages can help adult students "raise their hand" for further communication and engagement. Also, promoting specific solutions like credit evaluation platforms can appeal to adult students looking to maximize credit transfer opportunities.
