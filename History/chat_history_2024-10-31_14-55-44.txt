User: Do we have any policies around voting or Election Day

Bot: Yes, there is a mention of "Voting Leave" in the list of policies provided. It states that there is a policy for Voting Leave, which means employees might have provisions for taking time off to vote on Election Day. For specific details and guidelines, it would be best to refer to the Employee Handbook or reach out to HR for more information.
