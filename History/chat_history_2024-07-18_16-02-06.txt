User: how do i change my 401k contribution

Bot: To change your 401(k) contribution, you will need to access your 401(k) plan information provided by JULY Business Services. This information may be available through the Insperity portal or by directly contacting JULY Business Services. Typically, you can adjust your contribution rate by logging into your 401(k) account or by contacting the plan administrator. If you need assistance with this process, you may want to reach out to HR or the relevant benefits administrator for guidance on how to update your contribution.
