User: where can I find the Employee Change Form?

Bot: To find the Employee Change Form, you need to submit the Staff Changes Form if any of the following information changes about your direct report:
- Employee is becoming a manager (is not currently)
- Job title change
- Manager change
- Department/team change
- Change to the employee's weekly capacity (# of hours)

You can then send the completed and signed form to hr@carnegiehighered.com to complete the review process.
