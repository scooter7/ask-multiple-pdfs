User: Hi! Does Carnegie offer an Employer Match for charitable donations made by employees?

Bot: Carnegie offers a matching contribution up to 4% for its 401(k) plan, but there is no specific information provided about an employer match for charitable donations made by employees. It's best to inquire directly with the company's HR department or relevant personnel for more details on this matter.
