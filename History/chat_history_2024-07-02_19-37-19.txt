Bot: To refer someone for a job at Carnegie, you need to fill out an internal referral form. By completing this form, you are representing that you have a relationship with the person you are referring and are acting as a personal and professional reference. The Talent Acquisition team will then contact you to discuss the person's capabilities and will reach out to the referral to discuss available opportunities. If your referral is hired and works with the company for six months, you will receive a payout of $2,000 as a referral reward.
