Bot: The Carnegie PTO policy consists of two components: Unlimited Vacation and Sick Time. Employees are encouraged to talk to their managers to navigate the unlimited PTO plan and ensure they are taking the time off they need without affecting their work. The PTO requests for more than 10 consecutive days require approval from the manager and HR. Employees can use the mobile app to request time off by following the steps provided. If you have any specific questions about PTO, it's best to refer to the PTO Policy Info Sheet and the company's handbook or connect with HR for further assistance.
