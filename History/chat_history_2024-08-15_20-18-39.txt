User: vacation time

Bot: The company has an Unlimited Vacation policy, which means there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The policy is designed to allow employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet their needs without the stress of a capped number of days. Employees are encouraged to use at least 10-15 days per year for vacation, relaxation, personal needs, etc. You can request vacation time through the TimeStar system by selecting the dates and hours you are requesting, specifying the reason as vacation, and submitting the request for approval by your manager.
