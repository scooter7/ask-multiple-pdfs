User: what is the pto policy

Bot: The PTO (Paid Time Off) policy at Carnegie is comprised of two components: Unlimited Vacation and Sick Time. Employees are given access to a Central Admin PTO calendar as well as their divisional PTO calendar. Requests for more than 10 consecutive days off require approval from the manager and HR. It's recommended to communicate with your manager to navigate the unlimited PTO plan effectively. For more detailed information, you can refer to the PTO Policy info sheet and the company handbook.
