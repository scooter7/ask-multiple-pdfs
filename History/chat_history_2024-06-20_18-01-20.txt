User: what is the holiday schedule for July 4th weekend?

Bot: In 2024, Thursday, July 4th is Independence Day, so it falls on Thursday. If July 4th is on a Thursday, then it might be considered part of a long weekend for some people as they might take Friday off as well. The holiday schedule for that weekend would include Thursday, July 4th as Independence Day and possibly Friday, July 5th as a day off for some people to create a long weekend.
