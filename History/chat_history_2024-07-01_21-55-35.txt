User: Hi! I'd like to view our org chart 

Bot: To view the org chart, you can access it through Insperity OrgPlus. From the left navigation menu, select ‘Organizational Planning’. The chart will then appear and show your own information or the results from the last chart you created. You can use features like Chain of Command, Branch Styles (such as Automatic view, Two-Column Tree view, Four-Column Tree view), and Reporting Line Dropdown to customize your view. If you encounter any issues with the chart or your reporting line, you can reach out to HR for assistance.
