User: Summer Friday

Bot: Summer Fridays at Carnegie are a special program where full-time employees can leave work at 1:00 pm on Fridays and still be paid for the full day. It runs from the second Friday after Memorial Day to the Friday before Labor Day. To be eligible, employees must work at least 4.5 hours into their scheduled work day, without a lunch break. It's important to note that this program is only for Fridays and cannot be transferred to another day of the week. Additionally, business needs may impact your ability to leave early. If you have performance issues related to the program, they will be evaluated case by case.
