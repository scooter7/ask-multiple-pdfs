User: How do I cancel my health insurance?

Bot: I don't have the specific information on how to cancel health insurance at Carnegie. It would be best to reach out to the Human Resources department, specifically Allison Letizi or Kris Peterson, for guidance on canceling your health insurance. You can contact them at hr@carnegiehighered.com or kpeterson@carnegiehighered.com.
