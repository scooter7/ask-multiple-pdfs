User: vacation time

Bot: The company has an Unlimited Vacation policy, which means there is no cap on the amount of paid time off you can take each year. It is encouraged to use at least 10-15 days per year for vacation, relaxation, and rejuvenation. You can request time off through the TimeStar system by selecting the dates and hours you need and submitting them for approval by your manager.
