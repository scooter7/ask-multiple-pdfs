User: vacation time

Bot: The company offers Unlimited Vacation, which means there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. It is encouraged to use at least 10-15 days per year for vacation, relaxation, and rejuvenation. You can request vacation time through the TimeStar system by selecting the dates and hours you are requesting and specifying the reason for your time off as "Vacation." This request will be sent to your manager for review and approval.
