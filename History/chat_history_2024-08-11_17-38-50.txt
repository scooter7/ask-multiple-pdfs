User: vacation time

Bot: Employees are encouraged to use at least 10-15 days of vacation time per year, but there is no official cap on the number of days you can take. The Unlimited Vacation policy allows you to take as much time off as you need for rest, rejuvenation, and relaxation, as long as it is reasonable and respectful. You can request vacation time through the TimeStar system by selecting the dates and hours you need and submitting the request for your manager's approval. It is recommended to submit vacation requests with at least two weeks' notice for better planning.
