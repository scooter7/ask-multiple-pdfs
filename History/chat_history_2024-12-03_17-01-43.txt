User: where can I find the Employee Change Form?

Bot: To find the Employee Change Form, you can submit the Staff Changes Form if any of the following information changes about your direct report, such as becoming a manager, job title change, manager change, department/team change, or change to the employee's weekly capacity. You can then send the completed and signed form to hr@carnegiehighered.com for review.
