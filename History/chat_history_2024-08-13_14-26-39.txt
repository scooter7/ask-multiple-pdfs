User: employee referral

Bot: To refer someone for a job at Carnegie, you can fill out the internal referral form. By completing this form, you are representing that you have a relationship with the person you are referring and are acting as a personal and professional reference for them. The Talent Acquisition team will then reach out to you to discuss the person and their capabilities related to the position you are recommending them for. If your referral is hired and works with the company for six months, you could receive a referral bonus of $2,000. The referring employee must still be employed with Carnegie to receive the reward. Managers, Vice Presidents, contractors, and interns are not eligible for this benefit.
