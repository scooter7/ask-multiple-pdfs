User: What is our PTO policy?

Bot: At Carnegie, our PTO policy consists of two components: Unlimited Vacation and Sick Time. The Unlimited Vacation policy allows employees to take paid time off without a cap on the number of days. Sick Time provides 40 hours per year or as required by state law for employees who are ill. For more detailed information, you can refer to the company handbook or the PTO Policy info sheet. If you have any specific questions or need guidance on how to request time off, please reach out to HR or your manager.
