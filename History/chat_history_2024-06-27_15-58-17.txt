User: where can i find information on summer fridays?

Bot: You can find information on Summer Fridays in the company's policy documents, specifically the Unlimited Vacation plan and any related HR documents. These should outline the eligibility criteria, scheduling details, and any requirements or restrictions associated with participating in the Summer Friday program. If you're unable to locate this information, you may want to reach out to your HR department or supervisor for clarification.
