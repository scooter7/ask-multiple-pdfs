User: Vacation time

Bot: Carnegie's policy on vacation time is based on the Unlimited Vacation plan, which means there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The plan is designed to allow employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet their needs without the stress of a capped number of days. The company encourages employees to use at least 10-15 days per year for vacation, relaxation, personal reasons, and other needs. However, there is no official cap, and the specific amount of time off is ultimately up to the employee and their manager to determine what makes sense for their role and success. If you have any concerns or questions about requesting vacation time, it's advisable to speak with your manager or contact HR for support.
