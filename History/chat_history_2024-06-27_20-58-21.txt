User: where can i find information on summer fridays?

Bot: You can find information on Summer Fridays in Carnegie's HR policy or resource guide. This information would typically cover eligibility criteria, scheduling, use of Paid Time Off (PTO), and any other details related to the Summer Fridays program. If you are a full-time employee scheduled to work on Fridays, you may be eligible to participate in the program. Remember that the company reserves the right to make changes to the policy, so it's always a good idea to check with HR or your supervisor for the most up-to-date information.
