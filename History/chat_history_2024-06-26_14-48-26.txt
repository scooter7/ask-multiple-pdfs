User: how many days off a year do i have

Bot: There is no official cap on the number of days off you have per year with the Unlimited Vacation policy. It is recommended that employees use at least 10-15 days per year for vacation, relaxation, personal, religious, family needs, etc. Ultimately, the amount of time off you take is based on what you need and what makes sense for you, your role, and your success. It is best to speak to your manager for guidance on the amount of time off that is appropriate for you.
