User: vacation policies

Bot: Carnegie has an Unlimited Vacation policy, which means there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The policy is designed to allow employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet their needs without the stress of a capped number of days. Managers will consider factors like deadlines, projects, and team coverage when approving requests. Summer Fridays are also a continued benefit for Carnegie employees, where the offices close at 1:00 pm local time each Friday during the summer. This policy does not impact other time-off policies like Sick Time or Disability.
