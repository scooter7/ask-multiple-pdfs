User: I'm looking for the Carnegie Inside Out Recordings and decks, do you know where I can find that?

Bot: You can find the recordings and presentation decks from the 2024 Carnegie InsideOut sessions on the Carnegie website. There should be a section where you can view session recordings and access the presentation decks.
