User: what is our short term disability policy?

Bot: The short-term disability policy at Carnegie allows for employees, specifically birthing parents, to receive payments from both Carnegie and state disability programs concurrently. The payments from Carnegie will "top off" any other program payments received. Employees are responsible for filing all short-term disability and state program paperwork themselves. The short-term disability offered by NYLife pays 60% of the weekly salary for either four or six weeks, and benefits payable may be reduced if benefits are received from a state program. If there are additional state programs available, employees can speak to HR for more information.
