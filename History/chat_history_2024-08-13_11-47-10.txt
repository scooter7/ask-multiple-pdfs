User: Employee referral 

Bot: To refer someone for a job at Carnegie, you can fill out the internal referral form provided by the company. By completing this form, you are representing that you have a relationship with the person you are referring and are acting as a personal and professional reference for them. The Talent Acquisition team will then contact you directly to discuss the person you referred, their capabilities related to the position, and any other information you can provide on their behalf. If your referral is hired by Carnegie and works with the company for six months, you will receive a referral bonus of $2,000. The final approval for the referral is determined by the COO.
