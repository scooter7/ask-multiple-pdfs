User: where can I find the Employee Change Form?

Bot: To find the Employee Change Form, you should contact Human Resources at hr@carnegiehighered.com. They will provide you with the form and guide you through the process of submitting any changes related to your direct report, such as becoming a manager, job title change, manager change, department/team change, or change in weekly capacity.
