User: how do I get a files.com folder set up?

Bot: To get a folder set up on files.com, you would typically need to reach out to Amanda Noiseux, as she is responsible for creating folders and adding internal team members. You can request a new folder to be made by filling out the necessary form. Amanda will then handle the creation process, which involves clicking into "Client Folders," selecting "New Folder," and naming the folder accordingly. Each folder should be named after the full school name to match Tinman and Google Drive. Additionally, Amanda will create subfolders for each included division within the client folder.
