User: what is the holiday schedule for July 4th weekend?

Bot: In 2024, July 4th falls on a Thursday, which means that July 4th is Independence Day. As it is a public holiday, most employees would have that day off. Therefore, the holiday schedule for the July 4th weekend in 2024 would likely include Thursday, July 4th for Independence Day and potentially Friday, July 5th as well, depending on the company's policies.
