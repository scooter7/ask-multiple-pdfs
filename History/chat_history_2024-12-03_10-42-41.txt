User: where can I find the Employee Change Form?

Bot: You can find the Employee Change Form in the section where it says "Submit the Staff Changes Form" if any information changes about your direct report. This form is to be submitted for various changes like an employee becoming a manager, job title change, manager change, department/team change, or a change to the employee's weekly capacity.
