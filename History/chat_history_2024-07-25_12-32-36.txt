User: ticket nomination form

Bot: To participate in the ticket nomination process, you need to complete the ticket nomination form to share why someone has gone above and beyond for you. Reasons for nominations can vary, such as covering on a project, helping organize an event, or showing kindness to a teammate. You can also earn a ticket through participating in other Carnegie activities like team trivia. Once you complete the form, a physical ticket will be placed in a bowl at Carnegieâ€™s Westford office for the year-end drawing where winners can receive a $2,500 travel stipend and bragging rights.
