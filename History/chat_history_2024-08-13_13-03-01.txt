User: employee referral

Bot: To refer someone for a job at Carnegie, you would need to fill out an internal referral form. By completing the form, you are representing that you have a relationship with the person you are referring and are acting as a personal and professional reference. The Talent Acquisition team will contact you to discuss the person, their capabilities for the position, and any other information you can provide. If your referral is hired and works with the company for six months, you may receive a payout of $2,000 as a referral bonus. The final approval for the referral is determined by the COO. Managers, officers of the company, contractors, and interns are not eligible for this benefit.
