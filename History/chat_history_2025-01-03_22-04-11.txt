User: How do I submit changes to our standard terms and conditions?

Bot: To submit changes to standard terms and conditions, you should follow the process outlined in your company's documentation. Typically, this would involve creating a new Tinman Proposal Request with the context behind the change request. Once the client indicates they would like to change the scope, a Client Success Leader (CSL) should be involved in the process. If the change requires additional budget or a budget shift between divisions, a new Tinman Contract should be requested for the additional funds via the Contract Request form. It's important to document all changes and approvals properly, such as saving email threads on Google Drive. If you need specific guidance or forms, you may need to reach out to the HR department or the appropriate contact within your organization.
