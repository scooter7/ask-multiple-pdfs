User: How many days off do i get?

Bot: There is no official cap on the number of days off you can take. However, it is encouraged to use at least 10-15 days per year for purposes such as vacation, relaxation, personal, religious, family needs, etc. The historical Carnegie time-off schedule suggests 18-28 days, but the amount of time off is ultimately up to you and what you need. It's best to speak to your manager for guidance based on your role and success.
