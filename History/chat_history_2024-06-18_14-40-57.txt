User: vacation time

Bot: The vacation policy at Carnegie offers Unlimited Vacation days with no cap on paid time off each year. This policy is in place to promote a healthy lifestyle and trust in employees to take the time off they need for rest and rejuvenation. There is no specific limit on the number of vacation days you can take, but it is encouraged to use at least 10-15 days per year. Ultimately, the decision to approve vacation requests will be made by your manager based on what makes sense for you, your role, and your success. If you have any concerns or uncertainties about requesting time off, you can always talk to your manager or contact HR for support.
