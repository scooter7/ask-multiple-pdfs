User: How do I take leave

Bot: To take leave, you should submit a Parental Leave Notification Form to Human Resources at least 30 days prior to your intended leave. If you are a birth mother, the Business Office will submit your leave request. Parental leave should be requested through Insperity’s time and attendance module using the pay code “Parental Leave.” Additionally, for other types of time off, such as vacation, sick leave, bereavement, or personal emergencies, you can use the TimeStar system to log in via computer or the mobile app. Select the dates and hours you are requesting, choose the reason for your time off (e.g., Vacation, Sick), and then submit the request. It is recommended to submit all requests with at least two weeks’ notice, but last-minute requests are also understandable. For specific types of time off like jury duty, bereavement, or volunteer time, use the options provided in Insperity's time-off request system. Remember to communicate your leave with your manager for guidance and approval.
