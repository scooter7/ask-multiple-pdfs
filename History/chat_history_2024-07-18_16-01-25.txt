Bot: To change your benefits, you need to access the Benefits section through the left navigation menu. Once you are in the Benefits section, you can make changes to your benefits, including healthcare, insurance, and other offerings. If you're unsure how to make specific changes or need assistance, you can reach out to HR for guidance.
