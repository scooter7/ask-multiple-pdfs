User: where can I find the Employee Change Form?

Bot: You can find the Employee Change Form by submitting the Staff Changes Form to hr@carnegiehighered.com if there are changes such as an employee becoming a manager, job title change, manager change, department/team change, or a change to the employee's weekly capacity.
