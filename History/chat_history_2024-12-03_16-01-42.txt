User: where can I find the Employee Change Form?

Bot: The Employee Change Form can be found by submitting the Staff Changes Form to HR if there are any changes regarding your direct report, including becoming a manager, job title change, manager change, department/team change, or change in employee's weekly capacity. The form should be sent to hr@carnegiehighered.com.
