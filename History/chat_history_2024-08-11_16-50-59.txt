User: vacation time

Bot: Carnegie's Unlimited Vacation plan has no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The policy is set up to allow employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet their needs without the stress of a capped number of days. The company encourages employees to take at least 10-15 days off per year for vacation, relaxation, and personal needs. However, there is no official cap, and employees are encouraged to discuss their time off needs with their manager.
