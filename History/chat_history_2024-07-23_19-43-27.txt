User: what is the current maternity leave policy?

Bot: The current maternity leave policy at Carnegie provides up to 6 weeks of Paid Birth and Recovery Leave for birthing mothers immediately following the birth of the child. This can be followed by up to 6 weeks of Paid Parental Leave for a total of up to 12 weeks of combined pay. All other parents, including spouses, domestic partners, and adopting parents, are also eligible for up to 6 weeks of Paid Parental Leave. The policy allows for caring for the child, transitioning to parenthood, and adjusting to the new addition in the household. The leave will run concurrently with any state program available and will pay up to 100% of the new parent's regular salary during the term. Additionally, the policy allows for breastfeeding mothers to have time during the workday to express milk and provides the opportunity to ship milk home if needed while traveling for work. Parents of school-age children may also be eligible for time off to participate in their children's education and school activities.
