User: vacation policy

Bot: Carnegie's vacation policy is an Unlimited Vacation plan that has no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The plan allows employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet their needs without the stress of a capped number of days. Your manager will consider several factors in each request, including deadlines, projects, client needs, and team coverage. If your request is timely, reasonable, respectful, and considerate, the likelihood of approval is very high.
