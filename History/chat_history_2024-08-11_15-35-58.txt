User: vacation time policy

Bot: Carnegie's vacation policy is an Unlimited Vacation plan, which means there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The policy is designed to allow employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet their needs without the stress of a capped number of days. While there is no official cap, employees are encouraged to use at least 10-15 days per year for routine time off purposes such as vacation, staycation, relaxation, personal, religious, family needs, etc. Managers will consider factors like deadlines, projects, client needs, and team coverage when approving time off requests. Summer Fridays are a separate benefit that allows employees to leave at 1:00 pm local time each Friday during the summer without using a full PTO day.
