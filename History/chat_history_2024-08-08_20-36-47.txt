User: Can you find me carnegie's brand guidelines?

Bot: Yes, I can help you with that. The Carnegie brand guidelines can be found in the "Brand Guidelines" section under the marketing resources available for staff use. You can access these guidelines on the CD - Resources Drive in the "Marketing" folder. There, you will find information on the visual brand guide, Carnegie logos, presentation deck, editorial guide, brand messaging guide, and downloadable Carnegie fonts.
