User: where can I find the Employee Change Form?

Bot: The Employee Change Form can be submitted if there are changes in information such as an employee becoming a manager, job title change, manager change, department/team change, or a change in the employee's weekly capacity. The form is typically sent to hr@carnegiehighered.com for processing.
