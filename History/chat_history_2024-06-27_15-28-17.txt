User: where can i find information on summer fridays?

Bot: You can find information on Summer Fridays in the company's policies, specifically in the Unlimited Vacation plan and potentially in the Summer Friday Program policy. Reviewing these documents or reaching out to HR for clarification would be the best way to get detailed information on how Summer Fridays work at Carnegie.
