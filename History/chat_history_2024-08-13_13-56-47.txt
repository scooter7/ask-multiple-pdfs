User: employee referral

Bot: To refer someone for a job at Carnegie, you would need to fill out an internal referral form and provide information about your relationship with the person you are referring. The Talent Acquisition team will then contact you to discuss the candidate and their qualifications. If your referral is hired and stays with the company for six months, you would receive a referral bonus of $2,000. The referring employee must be employed with Carnegie to receive the reward. Managers, officers, contractors, and interns are not eligible for this benefit. The final approval is determined by the COO.
