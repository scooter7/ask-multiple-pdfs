User: what is the process for sending new hires the 30 day milestones for success?

Bot: To send new hires the 30-day milestones for success, the manager needs to schedule a recurring 1:1 meeting either weekly or biweekly with the new hire. After being employed for 30-35 days, all new hires are invited to complete a New Hire Feedback survey. Additionally, Allison Letizi from Human Resources reaches out to the new hire after two months to check in and see how they are doing. The new hire's manager is also sent Carnegie's 90-day evaluation form, and then the form is provided to the new hire with a due date communicated for completing it. Finally, a meeting is scheduled to discuss the filled-out form.
