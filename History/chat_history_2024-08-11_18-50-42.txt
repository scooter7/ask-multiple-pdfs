User: vacation time

Bot: For vacation time, Carnegie has an Unlimited Vacation policy, meaning there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The company encourages employees to use at least 10-15 days per year for vacation, relaxation, and rejuvenation. You can request vacation time through the TimeStar system by selecting the dates and hours you are requesting and the reason for your time off. Submit the request for your manager to review, approve, and/or discuss. It's recommended to submit requests with at least two weeks' notice, but last-minute requests are also understood.
