Bot: I don't see specific information about flexible spending accounts in the provided context. If you're looking for information about flexible spending accounts (FSAs), they are a type of account that allows you to set aside pre-tax money for certain eligible expenses like healthcare or dependent care. You would need to check with your employer or benefits provider for details on FSAs.
