User: what do I do after an amendment is signed

Bot: After an amendment is signed, you should follow the process outlined in the document. If the scope or budget of the project needs to change after the contract is signed, you can refer to the diagram provided to appropriately document and receive approvals on the changes. If the change requires additional budget, you should follow the steps outlined in the document based on whether it's within a Digital Media plan or not. This may involve sending an email for written approval, saving the email thread on Google Drive, or requesting a new Tinman Contract for additional funds via the Contract Request form. If the change requires a budget shift between Carnegie divisions, there are specific steps to follow as well. Make sure to refer back to the document for detailed instructions on how to proceed after an amendment is signed.
