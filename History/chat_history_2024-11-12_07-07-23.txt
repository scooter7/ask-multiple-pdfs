User: what is Carnegie's policy on working from another country?

Bot: I don't have specific information on Carnegie's policy regarding working from another country. It would be best to refer to Carnegie's Employee Handbook or contact the HR department directly for more details on their remote work policies, especially when it involves working from another country.
