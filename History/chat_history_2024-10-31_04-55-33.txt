User: Do we have any policies around voting or Election Day

Bot: Yes, Carnegie does have a policy around voting. They offer Voting Leave as one of their policies, allowing employees to take time off to vote. It's advisable to refer to the current year's Holiday Calendar to know the specific dates and details related to Election Day or voting leave.
