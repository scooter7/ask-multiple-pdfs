1. Log in to your Certify account.
2. Click on "New Expense Report" in the left-hand navigation.
3. Enter a name for the report, dates, description, and check off "billable to client" if applicable. Click "Next".
4. Within the expense report, towards the second half of the page, add expenses by typing the type, details, and selecting the receipt if needed.
5. If the company paid for the expense, change the last entry to “Company Paid - Do not reimburse me”.
6. Submit the report for approval by clicking “Submit for Approval”, reviewing the details, certifying the report, and clicking “Submit”.
7. Once all receipts are entered, at the top of the page, you can submit the report.

Remember that expenses are reimbursed every other Friday, so make sure to submit your report by the end of the day on the Friday prior to payment.
