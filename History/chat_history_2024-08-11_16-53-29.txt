User: vacation time

Bot: The vacation time policy at Carnegie is described as "Unlimited Vacation," meaning there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The plan allows employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet their needs without the stress of a capped number of days. The company encourages employees to take at least 10-15 days off per year for vacation, relaxation, and rejuvenation. There is no official cap on the number of days you can take, but it is recommended to discuss your time off plans with your manager to ensure they align with your role and overall success. If you are unsure about requesting time off, you can always talk to your manager or contact HR for support.
