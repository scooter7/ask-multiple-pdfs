User: how many days off do i get?

Bot: There is no official cap on the number of days off you can take. The policy encourages employees to use at least 10-15 days per year for purposes such as vacation, relaxation, personal needs, etc. Ultimately, the amount of time off you take should be based on what you need and what makes sense for your role and success. It's recommended to speak to your manager for guidance on the time that suits you best.
