Bot: Files.com is a secure file sharing service that is being implemented for data sharing and storage across the company. It is replacing the use of Google Drive and the materials site (FTP). Users can log in to Files.com by navigating to https://app.files.com/login, entering "carnegie" as the domain, and signing in with Microsoft Azure SSO. The platform includes a Files.com Drive, and there is a desktop version similar to Google Drive File Stream for moving lists without downloading them. Users are encouraged to start using Files.com immediately, with the goal of being fully transitioned by January 1. It has a built-in editor for making updates to lists without downloading them, and there is language available for explaining Files.com to clients when sharing lists with them.
