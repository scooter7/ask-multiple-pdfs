Bot: The company offers Unlimited Vacation time, which means there is no cap on the number of paid days off each year for employees. It is encouraged to take at least 10-15 days off per year for vacation, relaxation, and personal needs. The specific details and approval process for taking time off can be discussed with your manager.
