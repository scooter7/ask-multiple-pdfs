User: vacation time policy

Bot: The vacation policy at Carnegie offers Unlimited Vacation, which means there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The policy is designed to allow employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet their needs without the stress of a capped number of days. Employees are encouraged to take at least 10-15 days off per year for purposes like vacation, relaxation, personal, religious, family needs, etc. Managers will consider factors like deadlines, projects, client needs, and team coverage when approving time off requests. Additionally, Summer Fridays are still a benefit for Carnegie employees, where the offices close at 1:00 pm local time each Friday during the summer.
