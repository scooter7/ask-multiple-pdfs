User: where can i find information on summer fridays?

Bot: You can find information on Summer Fridays in the company's policy documents or handbook. It's advisable to review Carnegie's specific policy on Summer Fridays to understand the eligibility criteria, duration, and any specific guidelines related to taking time off on those days. If you can't find the information in your handbook, you may want to reach out to your HR department for clarification.
