User: vacation time limit

Bot: Carnegie's Unlimited Vacation policy has no cap on paid time off each year for employees. This means there is no specific limit to the amount of vacation time you can take as long as it is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet your needs. The goal is for employees to take time off for rest, rejuvenation, and relaxation without the stress of a capped number of days.
