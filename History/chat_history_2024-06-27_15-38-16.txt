Bot: The PTO policy at Carnegie includes Unlimited Vacation and Sick Time. Employees are encouraged to talk to their managers about taking time off and are advised to make time off requests at least two weeks prior. Requests for more than 10 consecutive days require approval from the manager and HR. Employees can use the mobile app to request time off by selecting 'Time Off' from the menu and following the prompts to input the dates and hours requested. For more detailed information, employees can refer to the PTO Policy Info Sheet and the company handbook.
