User: where can i find information on summer fridays?

Bot: You can find information on Summer Fridays in the company's policy documents, specifically in the section related to the Summer Friday Program. It outlines details such as eligibility criteria, duration, how to request time off, and any potential changes to the program. If you have access to an employee handbook or intranet, that would be a good place to start looking for this information. If you need further clarification, you can reach out to HR or your supervisor for more details.
