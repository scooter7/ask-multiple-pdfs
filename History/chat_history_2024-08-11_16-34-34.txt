User: vacation time limit

Bot: vacation time limit The Unlimited Vacation policy at Carnegie does not have a specific cap on the number of vacation days employees can take each year. Employees are encouraged to take at least 10-15 days per year for vacation, relaxation, personal needs, and more. There is no official limit, but it is recommended to speak with your manager to determine what makes sense for you and your role.
