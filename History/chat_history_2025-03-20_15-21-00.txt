User: travel policy

Bot: The travel policy at Carnegie states that employees will be reimbursed for all usual and reasonable travel, entertainment, and other expenses incurred on behalf of, and in connection with, company business. Both management and employees are responsible for complying with the policy, and any exceptions must be approved by the COO. It's recommended to review Carnegie's Travel Policy + Resource Guide before and during travel planning. All Carnegie-approved expenses should be tracked in the Certify platform for reimbursement.
