User: vacation time

Bot: The company policy encourages employees to take at least 10-15 days off for vacation, relaxation, and personal time. There is no official cap on vacation days, but it is recommended to speak to your manager for guidance on the time that makes sense for you and your role. Additionally, the Unlimited Vacation policy allows employees to take time off that is reasonable and respectful without a capped number of days.
