User: Do we have any policies around voting or Election Day

Bot: Yes, there is a policy around voting called "Voting Leave." This policy allows employees to take time off to vote. However, the specific details of this policy may vary each year, so it's important to check the holiday calendar for the current year to see if Election Day is included.
