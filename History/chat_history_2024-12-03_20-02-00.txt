User: where can I find the Employee Change Form?

Bot: You can find the Employee Change Form by submitting the Staff Changes Form if there are any changes related to your direct report, such as the employee becoming a manager, job title change, manager change, department/team change, or a change in the employee's weekly capacity (number of hours). The completed and signed form can be sent to hr@carnegiehighered.com for review and processing.
