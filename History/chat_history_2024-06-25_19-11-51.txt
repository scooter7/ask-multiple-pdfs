Bot: The vacation policy at Carnegie is an unlimited vacation plan, which means there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The plan allows employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to meet their needs without the stress of a capped number of days. It's all about trust and promoting a healthy lifestyle.
