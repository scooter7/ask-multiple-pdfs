User: where can I find the Employee Change Form?

Bot: You can find the Employee Change Form by submitting the Staff Changes Form if there are any changes related to your direct report, such as becoming a manager, job title change, manager change, department/team change, or changes to the employee's weekly capacity. Once the Staff Changes Form is completed, it should be sent to hr@carnegiehighered.com for processing.
