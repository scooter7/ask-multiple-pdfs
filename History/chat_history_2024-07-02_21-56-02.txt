Bot: To refer someone for a job at Carnegie, you need to fill out an internal referral form. By completing this form, you are representing that you have a relationship with the person you are referring and are acting as a personal and professional reference. The Talent Acquisition team will then contact you to discuss the person, their capabilities related to the position, and any other information you can provide on their behalf. If your referral is hired and stays with the company for six months, you will receive a referral bonus of $2,000.
