User: what is the process for sending new hires the 30 day milestones for success?

Bot: The process for sending new hires the 30-day milestones for success at Carnegie involves reaching out to the new hire after two months to check in and see how they are doing or feeling. Additionally, the new hire's manager is sent Carnegie's 90-day evaluation form which includes discussing what success looks like in the role, providing milestones of success at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months on the job. This helps the new hire understand how quickly they should be mastering the role responsibilities.
