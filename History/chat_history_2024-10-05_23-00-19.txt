User: vacation time

Bot: The company offers Unlimited Vacation, meaning there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The policy is designed to allow employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet their needs without the stress of a capped number of days. Employees are encouraged to take at least 10-15 days off per year for vacation, relaxation, and rejuvenation. It is recommended to speak to your manager for guidance on the time off that makes sense for you, your role, and your success.
