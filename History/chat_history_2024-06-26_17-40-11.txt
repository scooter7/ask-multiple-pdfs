User: how many days off do i get?

Bot: There is no official cap on the number of days off you can take. The policy encourages employees to use at least 10-15 days per year for purposes like vacation, relaxation, personal needs, etc. It ultimately depends on what you need and what makes sense for you, your role, and your success. It's recommended to speak to your manager for guidance on the amount of time off that would be suitable for you.
