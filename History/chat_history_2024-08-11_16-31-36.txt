User: vacation time

Bot: Carnegie's policy includes Unlimited Vacation days, which means there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The policy is designed to allow employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet their needs without the stress of a limited number of days. It is ultimately up to you and your manager to determine the appropriate amount of vacation time you should take based on your role and needs.
