User: vacation time policy

Bot: Carnegie's vacation time policy is called Unlimited Vacation, which means there is no cap on paid time off each year for employees. The policy is set up to allow employees to take time off that is reasonable, respectful, and productive to best meet their needs without the stress of a capped number of days. Employees are encouraged to take at least 10-15 days off per year for purposes such as vacation, relaxation, personal needs, etc. Managers will consider factors like deadlines, projects, client needs, and team coverage when approving time-off requests. Summer Fridays are also a continued benefit for Carnegie employees, allowing for early closures at 1:00 pm during the summer.
