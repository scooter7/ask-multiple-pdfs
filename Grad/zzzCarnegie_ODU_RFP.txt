We are confident Carnegie is the partner you need, and we’re excited to present this proposal. Working with us, you’ll:

Our team will set up an initial kickoff meeting to talk through key information including enrollment goals, key deadlines, target audiences, priority months, etc. to ensure we're aligned with what success looks like prior to launch. A plan will be shared showing projected budget allocation for each audience and the media placement recommendations to drive the outcomes ODUGlobal desires. 

Our team utilizes tools to look at projected campaign performance across different ad platforms to help determine the best tactics and budget to ensure we meet your goals. Being a higher ed focused agency, we have a database filled with past performance data to be able to better understand trends and benchmarks within different types of institutions, segments, audiences, and markets, allowing us to put forward an initial strategic plan. Any prior ODUGlobal marketing results that can be shared with our team will be reviewed and incorporated into our initial plan to make sure we’re working off prior findings.

At Carnegie, we lean on the best and most comprehensive sources available to construct the most efficient and impactful campaign strategy across all channels and to effectively deliver Return on Ad Spend (ROAS). This includes the ability to identify the most niche audience data to construct the most relevant campaigns possible.

As a full-service agency for higher education, our team is fully equipped to develop all creative development support needed for your campaigns. We offer a full suite of creative and marketing services, from campaign concept development and multimedia to digital ad design and placement. All our creative development is crafted with best practices for each platform we serve. Our team knows the digital nuances that will be most effective from a creative standpoint for ads served on websites or social media versus a billboard or print.

We’ll make suggestions regarding recommended calls to action, formatting, and more. If we receive any creative developed by you, we’ll provide feedback and additional recommendations if needed. 

Our Creative and Landing Page Development solutions include:

Display and Social Ad production: The very first touch point of any digital campaign is the ad a prospective student or parent sees. Our Design team can produce compelling ads to ensure your message is delivered clearly and resonates with your audience. Leveraging your branding guidelines and industry best practices for optimal results, we can quickly and cost-effectively develop the creative you need to improve the engagement of your Display ads or social media campaigns.

Animated Ad production: Utilizing animation in your digital campaigns is a great way to quickly grab the attention of your target audience and convey your brand message in a way that’s both effective and visually appealing.

Landing pages: Driving traffic from your ads to campaign-specific landing pages maximizes both your digital ad spend and your ability to convert and generate leads.

CRM Maximization

Utilizing an automation tool, Zapier, we can push lead delivery coming from all your advertising  campaigns on Google or social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, directly to your CRM. Our staff members are trained experts on setting up these integrations at the beginning of campaigns. 

Additionally, for clients utilizing Carnegie Clarity™—our proprietary website personalization and attribution tool—we can provide direct integration into Salesforce for web attribution and custom website interactions on a 1:1 identified user basis. 

On-site Advertising and Website Personalization

After our research, discovery, and strategic planning work, we will develop a full media plan, along with estimated inquiries and benchmarks per program.  

With every strategy, we are mindful of budget distribution across the different programs and audiences. We will work with you to confirm and align on an approach of distributing funds to programs with the most need, and our team is incredibly well versed in managing to that while also being nimble throughout the year as priorities change. 

Our recommended mix focuses heavily on channels that are most efficient at lead generation and conversion-oriented tactics that drive enrollment. We are also thoughtful about marrying the best fit channel to the program as we are well aware that a prospective Engineering student behaves differently than a prospective MPH student, for example. We also consider the student journey and ensure we are reaching prospects at each stage of their journey with the appropriate messaging and Calls-to-Action (CTA). 

Before tracking or optimizing any campaign, we ensure our team and yours are on the same page about enrollment goals, campaign goals, and delivering positive ROI/ROAS. 
On a campaign-level basis, goals are set so we can identify the platform-specific performance metrics we will optimize towards.

Example: By incorporating a combination of Carnegie Clarity data as well as offline conversion data imported into Google Ads itself, PPC campaigns drive conversions throughout the prospect funnel. Each campaign's success is evaluated based on the volume and efficiency by which it drives leads, applications, and enrollments. And these metrics are measured down to the keyword level, allowing for highly strategic optimizations and recommendations.

We will develop campaign and/or program specific landing pages that are optimized for conversion and involve the creative development and CTAs needed for optimal performance.
We utilize a proprietary system connected to each ad account through API integration to track which campaigns are pacing to spend in full, overspend, or fall short of the budget spend. 
Campaign pacing reports are pulled at least twice per week, and platform budgets are adjusted accordingly to help campaigns maintain their intended spend levels.

When Wake Forest University needed strategic direction and management of digital marketing for its graduate business programs, the University selected Carnegie through a competitive bid process. With limited in-house marketing capabilities, the University needed a partner with a higher education focus as well as systems and processes in place to efficiently and effectively strategize and buy advertising on a national scale. There was also an expressed need to better understand and track prospective students throughout the enrollment journey and minimize “ghost” applicants.
“We are fully convinced that Carnegie’s digital strategies helped us meet or exceed our enrollment goals this year. We consistently find anywhere from a third to half of our enrolled students actively engaged with our digital campaigns during their search.”
Michael Lamphier
Executive Director, Marketing and Communication
Wake Forest University School of Business

Wake Forest University

33
The Strategy
To achieve Wake Forest’s primary goals of solidifying brand awareness and building the school’s profile, Carnegie delivered a layered digital strategy incorporating PPC, Display Outreach and Retargeting, and LinkedIn. Through Carnegie ClarityTM, Wake Forest was able to build an understanding of engagement (number of visits, engagement during site visits, etc.) among prospective students. Campaigns took an always-on approach with an emphasis in September and January in order to reach prospective students set to complete their undergraduate degrees. The initial media strategy was outlined based on Wake Forest’s goal to drive a balance of inquiries and applications. After a few months of optimizing campaign performance to those strategies driving inquiries most affordably (mostly Lead Generation campaigns on Facebook and Instagram), we gained more robust data from Carnegie ClarityTM that indicated while PPC had a higher cost per lead due to higher competition, PPC was actually most effective at driving application submissions. Our team then made a recommendation to shift more budget to PPC, where there was an opportunity to increase traffic and overall applications.
The ResultsAfter implementing a robust digital strategy inclusive of paid media, SEO, attribution through Carnegie ClarityTM and Google Analytics consulting, we effectively optimized campaign performance to outperform Carnegie benchmarks in nearly every category, including cost per acquisition (CPA). During the 2019–2020 fiscal year, Carnegie campaigns drove over 1,700 total conversions, with nearly 450 of those conversion actions being application submissions. The School of Business met or exceeded all enrollment goals for fall 2020, citing digital marketing as a significant factor in its success.

“Partnering with Carnegie has been the best way to maximize our internal resources and equip us for growth.

The team is always one step ahead of us, which is crucial in a marketing environment that demands agility and flexibility.”
John BarnhartSenior Director, Marketing + Creative Services

35
The Situation
The University of Idaho needed an integrated digital marketing partner to achieve its enrollment growth goals. To support and enhance in-house capabilities, the University invested in additional marketing resources and chose Carnegie through a competitive RFP process. Having partnered previously with a local marketing agency, the University turned to Carnegie with a need for strategic higher education expertise. A state-funded institution, the University needed to maximize its resources and generate a proven ROI.
The Strategy
We strategized and implemented a full-funnel digital campaign that included Display Outreach and Retargeting, paid search, behavioral and list targeting, and social and streaming media to reach and engage prospective students at each phase of the enrollment journey. Campaigns targeted a variety of audiences, including prospective undergraduate, graduate, and transfer students as well as alumni. We also optimized landing pages and enhanced analytics to maximize advertising spend as well as the University’s ability to generate leads and track user traffic and behavior. We regularly met with University marketing leadership to review results and adjust tactics, messaging, and campaign strategy to drive the results the University needed.
The ResultsIn the first two years of our partnership, the University of Idaho enrolled two of its largest freshman classes in five years—an increase of 36% from fall 2020 to fall 2022. The University also saw an increase in graduate and overall enrollment. University marketing leadership recognized the power of Carnegie’s partnership in driving this enrollment growth and continues to work closely with us as a trusted marketing partner.

“Carnegie had already walked in our University’s shoes through our brand engagement. It made sense to entrust our program-level digital strategy to a partner who already understood our goals and who we are as an institution.”

Old Dominion University   |   Proposal

37
The Strategy
Carnegie’s Digital team implemented tactics including paid search, Display Outreach and Retargeting, Spotify, LinkedIn InMail, and lead generation campaigns on Facebook and Instagram. We customized digital messaging with the University’s personality traits identified in the University-wide reputation strategy engagement as both authentic to UNT and unique in the University’s market. And we continually optimized strategies based on performance, emphasizing various UNT personality traits based on results and audience engagement.

The ResultsUNT Online’s strategies drove impressive results both in terms of digital KPIs and enrollment outcomes. Campaigns generated consistent month-over-month growth, totaling more than 14 million impressions, 56,000 clicks, and 3,000 conversions. UNT also saw growth in awareness in just one year, with Carnegie’s campaigns generating more than 36,000 page views to UNT’s site and an overall increase of more than 110% in social media followers. In 2020, UNT generated more than 950 applications across the programs we promote—a 74% year-over-year increase. Further, there were more than 660 total accepted applications—an 87% increase year over year. Bolstered by Carnegie’s suite of innovative marketing strategies, UNT saw a 20% increase in overall graduate enrollment for fall 2020.

39
The Strategy
Our work started with building a cohesive System brand while acknowledging and preserving any established identities of each of the System Universities. Rooted in this research, Carnegie delivered brand architecture for a unified Missouri Online message to provide clarity and facilitate stronger awareness and enrollment growth. This architecture established a foundation for the development of naming recommendations, logos, campaign concepts, and an on-campus multimedia shoot. Carnegie also delivered custom audience segmentation the University has applied across marketing, including landing pages to tag personalized prospective student communication. We have since launched digital strategies primarily focused on building brand awareness, generating inquiries, and boosting application volume. Tactics include Display, social and streaming media, Search Engine Marketing, Search Engine Optimization, Google Analytics, and our proprietary Carnegie Clarity™ service, which tracks individual user activity throughout the enrollment funnel and personalizes experiences based on each user’s unique interests and actions.
The ResultsArmed with tools to speak with one voice across audiences, Missouri Online has unified its messaging across digital and print marketing, public relations, web, and more. Missouri Online has seen data that demonstrates an increase in brand lift, and many program-specific campaigns are seeing higher enrollment. Through Google’s Looker Studio dashboard, roughly 6,000 inquiries and 4,000 submitted applications were attributed to Carnegie digital campaigns in just nine months, with a notably low cost per conversion.

A large SEC school was struggling with differentiating its graduate school programs in a tight competitive environment.

The ResultsCarnegie employed a program-specific strategy so that each of the graduate programs had their own specific target audience and messaging which led to significant year-over-year (YoY) increases. Clarity, Carnegie’s website personalization tool, served individualized content to website visitors, which vastly increased conversion rates. As an example, with the EMBA program, visitors were 34% more likely to engage and convert when Carnegie’s proprietary website tool, Clarity was used. Deploying a program-specific strategy with personalized messaging also generated 117% YoY increase in inquiries and 218% YoY increase in applications for a total of 1,847 inquiries and 1,079 application submissions in a two year period.

We took a full-funnel approach to the campaigns from lead generating to remarketing to personalized website interactions using Carnegie’s proprietary Clarity tool. In addition to the lead generation campaigns, Carnegie also deployed a brand awareness campaign to generate brand recognition and affinity. The campaigns were tested and optimized via a/b variant testing, creating lookalike audiences off of first-party data lists, landing page conversion rate optimization, etc. The inquiry to application conversion rate was 32% when a Carnegie ad was the first source of engagement with over 900 students enrolling as a result of interacting with a Carnegie campaign. This resulted in achieving the highest Winter enrollment since 2010.
