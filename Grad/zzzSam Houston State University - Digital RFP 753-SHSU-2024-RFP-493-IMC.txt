Sam Houston State University 
Huntsville, Texas 


Dear Members of the Review Committee:

Thank you for the opportunity to submit a proposal for digital marketing support! 

Our proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy designed to leverage the power of digital marketing channels to increase visibility, engage your target audience, and ultimately drive inquiries. And we believe that we’re uniquely positioned to continue our partnership. Working with us, you’ll:

Drive awareness, interest, and action with the audiences and in the markets you need. Working exclusively in higher education, we are experts in understanding the journey from awareness and interest to action, and leveraging research and data to optimize channel and market strategy across all audiences. With a wide array of programs, a diverse mix of prospective audiences, and a vast market opportunity for your offerings, Carnegie will draw upon our collective resources and expertise specific to marketing and lead generation success to accomplish the quality performance needed to achieve your goals.
Bolster undergraduate, graduate, online, and transfer  admissions recruitment and yield through mid-funnel conversions. Enrollment success goes far beyond just a volume-focused lead generation approach, and Carnegie is uniquely positioned to drive mid-funnel conversions and yield based on our comprehensive suite of solutions. From CRM integration and website optimization to effective creative development and communications strategy, our partnership will deliver value throughout the entire funnel.
2
Embrace a philosophy and approach that is markedly different and fundamentally better than the prevailing standard. We have always led with innovation. We introduced digital marketing to higher education when the industry relied on name purchases and mailers, we developed a proprietary psychographic approach to audience targeting to challenge the industry’s reliance on demographics, and we have been on the cutting edge of technology integration in a world where our tools and systems are more critical than ever. Our team brings that same vigor to our partnership. 

Have a partner that knows you well. Having worked closely with you on Digital and Event strategy, we’re armed with insights about your institution. Our continued conversations  lead us to believe that we’re uniquely positioned to partner with you on your ongoing  transformation to highlight what is authentically Sam Houston State University. Working with Carnegie, you’ll have a partner who is invested in your success and understands what makes you, you. 

As you review our proposal, please contact me if you have any questions or would like additional information. Hopefully, this proposal will serve as a springboard for additional conversation and collaboration — we’d love to tailor our approach to your needs.

Executive Summary of Proposal 
Ben

Ben
Student Search dates back to the 70’s and really became popular as a concept in the 1990s when colleges would purchase SAT/ACT names to initiate a comprehensive direct mail and email campaign to recruit students. Student Search was born from a time when we had the world wide web/websites, email and CRMs…. access to names via College Board and ACT’s services. And then starting around 2010 and increased number of college going students…So as an industry we leveraged these tools and purchased names…

In order to enhance student recruitment efforts, Sam Houston State University is seeking a qualified partner to assist digital marketing campaigns for brand, enrollment, academic programs, SHSU Online, and events. The academic program campaign will consist of at least sixteen academic programs selected from the University’s eight colleges with the goal of creating awareness, generating inquiries, and generating applications leading to enrollment. The SHSU Online campaign will consist of advertising all online programs with the goal of creating awareness, generating inquiries, and generating applications leading to enrollment. Event campaigns will have the goal of awareness and ticket sales.
In response to these goals, in this proposal, we have outlined and detailed the following:
Carnegie’s extensive history and experience as a leader and innovator in the world of higher education marketing. 
A high level summary of our pricing and investment recommendations, to include highlights of the strategies involved, as well as a link to a preliminary media and budget plan that covers the different areas SHSU is looking to address - brand awareness, undergraduate, graduate, online, and transfer program marketing, and marketing for events. This plan also leans into our existing and historical work in these areas with SHSU to date. 
An overview of Carnegie’s qualifications and experience including our digital marketing expertise,  comprehensive services and approach, along with case studies, performance examples, and references.
Specific connections to SHSU’s asks in section D of the RFP, focused on Product and Service Specifications, including marketing planning, account management, capabilities related to the needs described, and reporting.
Overall, we’ve laid out a proposal that expresses our enthusiasm for being the partner you’re looking for, that leans into the existing experience and history we have working with Sam Houston State University,  and reflects the confidence we have in helping you to accomplish the goals you’re looking to achieve.

Google
Premier Partner
Each year Google recognizes the achievements of top-performing digital marketing partners across the globe by awarding Premier Partner status. Only 3% of Google Partners achieve this honor. Our Google partnership has direct benefits for you in the form of expertly trained staff, dedicated Google account and technical support, and early access to exciting beta products.


Campaign and strategic success should not be defined by number of purchased names or high-volume clicks and conversions alone. Best practices need to be applied that consider things like market interest, decision-making timelines and differences for undergrad, grad, transfer, and online  students, costs per keyword, program-specific conversion strategies, website engagement and re-engagement, and ultimately, how a full-funnel marketing approach will result in actual enrolled students. 

At Carnegie, we start with your end goal, and have the expertise to carry that through to a performance and outcome focused approach at every step of the journey.

Performance and Outcomes as our Benchmark

Your Stated Goal: Inquiries, applications, and enrollment for on-campus and online programs, as well as ticket sales for events.
This is where we begin. With an understanding of your ultimate end goal, we build our strategy across the entire funnel to maximize our opportunities to reach and exceed the goals you’ve described.
Milestone Markers
From clicks and conversions, to website engagement and behavior, to inquiries and applications, to ROI and ROAS - we’ll determine together the milestones markers that will equate to success, and we’ll construct and optimize our campaigns and strategies around those.
Performance Over Channel
As a full-service agency with expertise across all platforms, we prioritize performance over channel. If Facebook is delivering high-volume but low-quality leads (as an example), and a pivot to more LinkedIn will drive stronger results, we’re able to adapt and optimize in any direction.
Prioritization from Collaboration 
Not all programs are equal when it comes to market opportunity and marketing cost possibilities. We bring market insights, historical campaign benchmarks, and real-time data to work with you to prioritize focus, spend, and performance in the ways you need, and that will be the most successful.
Scalable and Program/Campaign Specific Conversion Optimization 
A Call-To-Action or conversion expectation needs to be different when someone is Retargeted off your program page versus when they search for your program on Google for the first time. From program specific landing page development and lead gen forms to ad messaging specific to stage of the funnel, we apply best practices and expertise to develop scalable conversion-centric models to both optimize the user experience and accomplish the milestone markers you need.

Understanding and Leaning Into Your Institution's Brand Identity: Central to marketing success is a deep understanding of your institution's brand identity. And the marketing of your programs should reflect the unique mission, values, and educational offerings that set you apart. Carnegie prioritizes the development of, and application of, your institution's brand identity, to ensure marketing efforts build trust and credibility, and foster stronger connections with potential learners.
Collaboration with In-House Perspective and Expertise: The wealth of internal resources you have, including faculty expertise, marketing teams, and academic departments, should never be ignored. Carnegie prides ourselves on collaboration, and a significant aspect of our partnership would involve harnessing the perspectives and experience your teams and staff can offer regarding insights into program highlights and benefits and the development of compelling messaging that resonates with target audiences.
Authentic Content and Communications: Effective marketing is driven by building authentic connections with prospective students and audiences. Our strategies will involve providing compelling and valuable content, along with segmented, relevant, and personalized messaging to support students throughout the enrollment journey, and contribute to helping students achieve their academic goals along with your enrollment success.

Equally important is ensuring the strategies, tactics, and technologies are in place to drive yield further down the funnel. From digital marketing and website responsiveness, to CRM integration and communication strategy, these layers of a full funnel approach are critical.
Full-Funnel Attribution: Embracing full-funnel attribution elevates your campaign measurement to make data-backed decisions, and unlock the full potential of your advertising efforts.

The Strategy
Norwich University - Online selected Carnegie as its digital partner due to our depth and breadth of knowledge in higher education digital marketing. Their goal was to expand awareness and build inquiry pools for their online programs, particularly among military-connected audiences. Carnegie honed in on their target audience by focusing strategies on military bases, academies, and DMAs near military towns.

The Situation
Manhattanville College needed a comprehensive strategic marketing partner across digital and Slate services. The College had worked with Carnegie in smaller capacities but launched a fully integrated partnership in 2021.

The Strategy
Following an in-depth discovery process around their target audiences and goals, we launched a comprehensive undergraduate-focused enrollment marketing plan in fall 2021. Strategies included Display Retargeting, social media, paid search, IP Targeting, and Search Engine Optimization. We also worked with Manhattanville for Slate communications and optimization, ensuring the College was leveraging the CRM to its full potential in tandem with digital strategies. Our recommendations for Manhattanville focused on maximizing its opportunities as a small college in a competitive market. 

The ResultsDuring the last two years, Manhattanville has seen increases in all areas of the first-year enrollment funnel, including a more than 30% increase in applications and admits, and more than 60% increase in new student deposits. We are proud to serve as ongoing trusted partners across our full suite of services.

32%inquiry to application submission conversion rate when Carnegie is first source

HIGHESTWinter enrollment 
since 2010
The ResultsCarnegie developed a robust, multi-channel strategy with dedicated campaigns for each audience segment, including undergraduate, transfer, non-traditional/online, and graduate students. We took a full-funnel approach to the campaigns from lead generating to remarketing to personalized website interactions using Carnegie’s proprietary Clarity tool. In addition to the lead generation campaigns, Carnegie also deployed a brand awareness campaign to generate brand recognition and affinity. The campaigns were tested and optimized via a/b variant testing, creating lookalike audiences off of first-party data lists, landing page conversion rate optimization, etc. The inquiry to application conversion rate was 32% when a Carnegie ad was the first source of engagement with over 900 students enrolling as a result of interacting with a Carnegie campaign. This resulted in achieving the highest Winter enrollment since 2010.

The University of Idaho

The Situation
The University of Idaho needed an integrated digital marketing partner to achieve its enrollment growth goals. To support and enhance in-house capabilities, the University invested in additional marketing resources and chose Carnegie through a competitive RFP process. Having partnered previously with a local marketing agency, the University turned to Carnegie with a need for strategic higher education expertise. A state-funded institution, the University needed to maximize its resources and generate a proven ROI.
The Strategy
We strategized and implemented a full-funnel digital campaign that included Display Outreach and Retargeting, paid search, behavioral and list targeting, and social and streaming media to reach and engage prospective students at each phase of the enrollment journey. Campaigns targeted a variety of audiences, including prospective undergraduate, graduate, and transfer students as well as alumni. We also optimized landing pages and enhanced analytics to maximize advertising spend as well as the University’s ability to generate leads and track user traffic and behavior. We regularly met with University marketing leadership to review results and adjust tactics, messaging, and campaign strategy to drive the results the University needed.
The ResultsIn the first two years of our partnership, the University of Idaho enrolled two of its largest freshman classes in five years—an increase of 36% from fall 2020 to fall 2022. The University also saw an increase in graduate and overall enrollment. University marketing leadership recognized the power of Carnegie’s partnership in driving this enrollment growth and continues to work closely with us as a trusted marketing partner.

D.2.a. Marketing Plan: A comprehensive written digital marketing plan to include strategy, advertising venues, reporting and metrics.
Our team will set up an initial kickoff meeting to talk through key information including enrollment goals, key deadlines, target audiences, priority months, etc. to ensure we're aligned with what success looks like prior to launch. A plan will be shared showing projected budget allocation for each audience and the media placement recommendations to drive the outcomes Sam Houston State University desires. 

Our team utilizes tools to look at projected campaign performance across different ad platforms to help determine the best tactics and budget to ensure we meet your goals. Being a higher ed focused agency, we have a database filled with past performance data to be able to better understand trends and benchmarks within different types of institutions, segments, audiences, and markets, allowing us to put forward an initial strategic plan. Any prior SHSU marketing results that can be shared with our team will be reviewed and incorporated into our initial plan to make sure we’re working off prior findings.

At Carnegie, we lean on the best and most comprehensive sources available to construct the most efficient and impactful campaign strategy across all channels and to effectively deliver Return on Ad Spend (ROAS). This includes the ability to identify the most niche audience data to construct the most relevant campaigns possible. 

Resources include:
DV360 signals/audience building
Google Keyword Planner
LinkedIn and Meta's audience builders
Your Google Analytics and/or Google Search Console accounts
Pandora and Hulu audience data
SEMRush, Screaming Frog, Answer the Public
AudienceDesigner by Semcasting (ADS)
Carnegie Clarity audience development

The combination of these resources and access enable us to take a comprehensive look at audiences, channels, and performance to apply precise media and budget allocation for each of SHSU’s campaigns.


As a full-service agency for higher education, our team is fully equipped to develop all creative development support needed for your campaigns. We offer a full suite of creative and marketing services, from campaign concept development and multimedia to digital ad design and placement. All our creative development is crafted with best practices for each platform we serve. Our team knows the digital nuances that will be most effective from a creative standpoint for ads served on websites or social media versus a billboard or print. In terms of our company’s creative outlook, any creative work we do starts with ensuring we’ve done all we can to understand your brand, the authentic personality of your institution, and what will resonate most with the specific audiences you need to make a connection with. We are equipped to develop the creative and ads for any of the platforms and strategies we’re partnered with you for, and our team of inbound and web experts can provide you with unmatched content development. 

From a process standpoint, if we're handling the Display or social creative for marketing campaigns, we first work with you to gather all necessary assets. Our Creative team then works on developing creative mock-ups that will resonate with your unique identity, which we then send for review, feedback, and approval. We’ll make suggestions regarding recommended calls to action, formatting, and more. If we receive any creative developed by you, we’ll provide feedback and additional recommendations if needed. 

Our Creative and Landing Page Development solutions include:

Display and Social Ad production: The very first touch point of any digital campaign is the ad a prospective student or parent sees. Our Design team can produce compelling ads to ensure your message is delivered clearly and resonates with your audience. Leveraging your branding guidelines and industry best practices for optimal results, we can quickly and cost-effectively develop the creative you need to improve the engagement of your Display ads or social media campaigns.

Animated Ad production: Utilizing animation in your digital campaigns is a great way to quickly grab the attention of your target audience and convey your brand message in a way that’s both effective and visually appealing. Our Design team can produce highly engaging HTML5 Display banner ads or short form animated ads for platforms such as Snapchat, allowing you to deliver more information to your prospective student or parent audience in a dynamic, compelling way.
Landing pages: Driving traffic from your ads to campaign-specific landing pages maximizes both your digital ad spend and your ability to convert and generate leads. From strategy and design to hosting and A/B testing, our in-house Creative team will leverage industry best practices and work with your institution to produce landing pages that serve all your campaign needs and generate inquiries. We can also integrate with your CRM for the ultimate efficiency in real-time lead delivery.

After our research, discovery, and strategic planning work, we will develop a full media plan, along with estimated inquiries and benchmarks per program.  

With every strategy, we are mindful of budget distribution across the different programs and audiences. We will work with you to confirm and align on an approach of distributing funds to programs with the most need, and our team is incredibly well versed in managing to that while also being nimble throughout the year as priorities change. 

Our recommended mix focuses heavily on channels that are most efficient at lead generation and conversion-oriented tactics that drive enrollment. We are also thoughtful about marrying the best fit channel to the program as we are well aware that a prospective Engineering student behaves differently than a prospective MPH student, for example. We also consider the student journey and ensure we are reaching prospects at each stage of their journey with the appropriate messaging and Calls-to-Action (CTA). 

Before tracking or optimizing any campaign, we ensure our team and yours are on the same page about enrollment goals, campaign goals, and delivering positive ROI/ROAS. 
On a campaign-level basis, goals are set so we can identify the platform-specific performance metrics we will optimize towards.

Example: By incorporating a combination of Carnegie Clarity data as well as offline conversion data imported into Google Ads itself, PPC campaigns drive conversions throughout the prospect funnel. Each campaign's success is evaluated based on the volume and efficiency by which it drives leads, applications, and enrollments. And these metrics are measured down to the keyword level, allowing for highly strategic optimizations and recommendations.

We will develop campaign and/or program specific landing pages that are optimized for conversion and involve the creative development and CTAs needed for optimal performance.
We utilize a proprietary system connected to each ad account through API integration to track which campaigns are pacing to spend in full, overspend, or fall short of the budget spend. 
Campaign pacing reports are pulled at least twice per week, and platform budgets are adjusted accordingly to help campaigns maintain their intended spend levels.
