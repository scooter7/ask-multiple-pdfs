Thank you for your interest in partnering with Carnegie for your Slate Implementation. Our team is committed to providing you with the bandwidth, support, and best practices to make this major time investment as valuable as possible.

We’re excited about the possibility of partnership, and hope that you will find the next few pages helpful as you consider next steps.
Kindly,Your Carnegie Team

About Carnegie
Ben

Ben
Student Search dates back to the 70’s and really became popular as a concept in the 1990s when colleges would purchase SAT/ACT names to initiate a comprehensive direct mail and email campaign to recruit students. Student Search was born from a time when we had the world wide web/websites, email and CRMs…. access to names via College Board and ACT’s services. And then starting around 2010 and increased number of college going students…So as an industry we leveraged these tools and purchased names…

Human Connection
4
Our core philosophy fuses the principles of psychology with marketing and enrollment innovation. The technical term for this is psychometrics. We think of it as empathy. 

By measuring a student’s unique behaviors and motivators and marketing to those needs and expectations, we help our client to create real conversations … one student at a time.  

Human Connection leads to action, enrollment, retention, and lasting affinity.

We believe that genuine connection is the key to capturing attention and building relationships.

Primary Drivers
What motivates them to give?
Fulfill unmet needs of others
Compassion for the underserved
Big impact through small actions
Responsibility for lifting others up
Primary Roadblocks
What might prevent the organization from connecting?
Lack of personal connection, even with recognition efforts
Inadequate communication frequency
Not capitalizing on their interest in being personally engaged with the organization
Insufficient illustration of the personal impact the organization has on people’s lives
Connection Strategy
Connect with Mission Mavens using lighthearted Red messaging and images; illustrate an understanding that this is a personal cause for them and showcase the organization’s impact on individuals’ lives. As the most highly engaged Dart, they are open to frequent communication, especially on activities like The Aging Advantages Faith Summit and The Provider Fair. (Note: While they will connect with engaging and entertaining Red, be sure that tone still maintains an understanding of personal commitment and passion for the cause.)

Acuity Dart 1: Grateful Giver
Grateful Givers highly trust the organization to do the right thing and provide for everyone’s loved ones. Their reflection on the organization’s impact and their desire to leave a legacy themselves motivates them to show up and give to the organization. They or a loved one may have received care in the past, leaving a lasting impression that inspires them to pay it forward. Grateful Givers are often busy caring for others, so they may fly under the radar and not be overly involved in events or meetings. However, Grateful Givers are great storytellers on behalf of the organization because of their positive experiences.

Acuity Dart 2: Grateful Giver
Primary Drivers
What motivates them to give?
Removing barriers for others
Creating a legacy
Equity and compassion for all
Responsibility for improving others’ lives
Primary Roadblocks
What might prevent the organization from connecting?
Too much communication on events or other activities that are not high interest
Lack of visibility for these active information seekers, especially in the community
Inability to quantify the organization’s impact clearly and demonstrate immediacy
Lack of understanding of how to recognize them (need to connect donation to legacy)
Connection Strategy
Grateful Givers are attracted to the nurturing and caring nature of the Purple archetype. Communications should show compassion with individual impact but also portray a strong, confident tone that illustrates immediate impact. They are less likely to be engaged and prefer less frequent communication, so ensure messaging is direct and presents clear benefits. The organization’s strategy of prioritizing data-driven decision-making will especially resonate with this Dart.
