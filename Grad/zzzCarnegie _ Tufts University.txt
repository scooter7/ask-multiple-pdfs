Somerville, MA 02144


Dear Frank:

Thank you for the opportunity to submit a proposal for digital media and management support!
We are confident we are uniquely equipped to partner with Tufts for comprehensive digital marketing for graduate and professional programs. Working with us, you’ll:
Have a partner who knows graduate and professional digital marketing. Since 1985, we’ve been at the forefront of higher education marketing. We will bring expertise and insights to every conversation to advise on the best path forward. In addition to direct experience with similar clients, the Association for Graduate Enrollment Management has looked to Carnegie as one of its original strategic partners for the past several years. NAGAP works with us for research efforts, thought leadership content, webinars, white papers, and marketing insights in the world of graduate enrollment management.
Tap into an unmatched depth and breadth in end-to-end capabilities. Our team is made up of experts in all areas of higher education marketing. In this proposal, we have outlined potential team members’ qualifications in graduate digital marketing. We will bring a thoughtful perspective to each project that is steeped in integration and collaboration across all of these areas. Our deep bench of talent also allows us to be nimble as new challenges arise. 
2
Embrace a philosophy and approach that is markedly different and fundamentally better than the prevailing standard. We have always led with innovation. We introduced digital marketing to higher education when the industry relied on name purchases and mailers, we developed a proprietary psychographic approach to audience targeting to challenge the industry’s reliance on demographics, and we have been on the cutting edge of technology integration in a world where our tools and systems are more critical than ever. Our team will bring that same vigor to our partnership. 

As you review our proposal, please contact us if you have any questions or would like additional information. Hopefully, this proposal will serve as a springboard for additional conversation and collaboration — we’d love to tailor our approach to your needs. 

Now, let’s go!

About Carnegie

Student Search dates back to the 70’s and really became popular as a concept in the 1990s when colleges would purchase SAT/ACT names to initiate a comprehensive direct mail and email campaign to recruit students. Student Search was born from a time when we had the world wide web/websites, email and CRMs…. access to names via College Board and ACT’s services. And then starting around 2010 and increased number of college going students…So as an industry we leveraged these tools and purchased names…

Digital Marketing Strategy
And Execution


Our full media plan is linked here with estimated inquiries per program. We’ve also detailed it below and in the following slides. 

With this strategy, we were mindful of your budget distribution across the different schools and programs. We appreciate your approach of distributing funds to programs with the most need, and our team is incredibly well versed in managing to that while also being nimble throughout the year as priorities change. Our recommended mix focuses heavily on channels that we find are the most efficient lead generation tactics. We were also thoughtful around marrying the best fit channel to the program as we are well aware that a prospective Engineering student behaves differently than a prospective MPH student, for example. We also put thought into the student journey, and ensured we are reaching prospects at each stage of their journey with the appropriate messaging and CTA. Our initial recommendation includes:
Leveraging Facebook/Instagram and LinkedIn Conversation Ads to reach in-market graduate prospects while they are looking to network and further their career. The goal of these tactics is awareness and lead generation. 
Leveraging video forward channels like YouTube, TikTok and OTT to generate brand awareness and name recognition for the new DPT Atlanta program slated to begin Fall 2025..
Including Google PPC to stay in front of active searchers based on a comprehensive keyword strategy including program, geography, and brand related keywords.

WHAT TO EXPECT


Our Process
We'll start our partnership by meeting with key stakeholders, gathering any relevant research conducted, and analyzing previous campaigns and your strategic plans moving forward. A thorough understanding of your big-picture needs and how they align with current enrollment goals is necessary to create the most effective marketing plan. We’ll confirm goals, audiences, and priorities for this fiscal year and walk through our processes and systems for information access and sharing. From there, we will construct and set up campaigns, working hand-in-hand with your team to confirm assets, creative, and plans are managed effectively. Your day-to-day point of contact will be an Account Manager—all day-to-day communications funnel through this contact to provide you with a clear and consistent channel to your Carnegie team. We utilize the project management software Asana for high-level phased planning and the minute management of tasks and subtasks. 

Implementation
We’ll assemble a team of strategists, campaign managers, creatives, researchers, and a dedicated account manager to support all University projects. Your digital strategy director will work with you to define scope and objectives, playing an advisory role and serving as your strategic expert. Your digital strategy director reports directly to Carnegie’s Digital Strategy AVP, who brings a decade of expertise in strategic campaign development for higher education to Carnegie’s team. Tactical duties for the campaign will be primarily managed by digital strategists and specialists who will set up, monitor, and continually optimize and restructure campaigns as needed to maintain performance.
Measuring Results
Starting from project kickoff and throughout our partnership, our team will work with you to translate campaign objectives into the right metrics and goals. These will become the focal point for campaign performance measurement, reporting, and analysis. KPIs are constantly monitored to prove strategy and tactic effectiveness and make campaign optimizations. Carnegie will work with you to deploy the right tracking technologies to collect data tied to the defined KPIs. This ranges from the placement of ad platform tracking pixels to helping configure web analytics tracking. The data collected is then used in our live reporting dashboards built on leading data visualization platforms. These dashboards are available 24/7 and updated daily, making campaign results and ROI fully accessible at any time. In addition to the live dashboards, our strategists will provide analysis, insights, and next steps based on campaign performance.

Sample Timeline


Day 1 (based on Tufts University availability): Strategy meeting. Collect feedback on initial proposal. Gather additional information regarding campaign priorities, audiences, geographies, current or new media in place, upcoming events/important dates, program needs, etc.
Week 1 (sometimes in coordination with strategy meeting): Campaign kickoff meeting. Review media plan together, collecting feedback and any additional information still needed. Set launch date.
After kickoff meeting: Static assets collection + technical startup. Following the discovery calls, all lists, images, data, etc., being sent from your team will be collected. Required account access should also be granted/approved. These items vary by campaign. 
First two weeks and ongoing: Asset review + approval. All assets will be sent to you for review and approval. This is an ongoing process. Assets may include banner ads, landing pages, keyword strategy, Facebook strategy and text, etc. The majority of this phase will take place prior to launch.
Week 3–4 (sooner if possible): Digital campaigns live. Once tactics, channels, priority audiences, and target geographies are confirmed, campaigns will be launched.
First month of campaign: First full month of insights annotated in your dashboard and any initial recommendations from the digital strategist will be made. Your live dashboard will display metrics to include ad creative performance, click and conversion data, geographic focus, and traffic engagement in analytics.
Ongoing: The performance dashboard serves as the most transparent and up-to-date way to stay in tune with the campaign’s performance. Your digital strategist will add campaign insights and note all optimizations made throughout the month directly onto the dashboard for you to review at any time. Recommendations, based on performance, will be delivered by email or on a strategy call. Calls/emails can include evaluation of deliverables, opportunities for improvement, metric highlights, creative analysis, verification of any additional timeline needs, and campaign additions or budget reallocation. Adjustments to campaign are made as needed and/or discussed in this meeting. 


33
DATA TRANSPARENCY


Ensuring you have immediate and ongoing visibility into your campaign performance is a priority for Carnegie. We'll provide a live dashboard so you can monitor, track, and review essential KPIs and performance metrics at any moment throughout your campaign. This allows for continuous evaluation of our strategies and gives us the ability to provide consistent and ongoing optimizations and enhance campaign results. 
In addition to your live dashboard, we’ll provide regular in-depth analyses into the performance of your campaigns, with our team of experts delivering key insights, trends, recommendations, and pacing for your specific goals. We’re committed to your success, and we prioritize your performance above all else.

BostonUniversitySchool ofPublic Health
Boston University needed to promote its School of Public Health on Google organic search to drive organic traffic and grow its enrollment funnel.

The Strategy
 Carnegie took a holistic approach to the project, combining optimization of existing content with a technical audit of the SPH website and the optimization of SPH’s Google My Business property. Through the technical site audit, we identified issues that could prevent Google from effectively crawling and indexing the SPH website and negatively impact visibility. Once these issues were eliminated, the other SEO tactics delivered even greater impact. We optimized 12 pages of existing content, inserting high-value keywords and restructuring content to meet SEO best practices. Finally, we optimized the SPH’s Google My Business property—an essential tactic for securing visual and high-value positions within the local organic search results.
+
4 million organic search impressions over three months, with a click-through rate of 3%

7.12% year-over-year increase in organic traffic to the SPH website


36
The ResultsBoston University’s School of Public Health increased its organic rankings in traditional search and dramatically increased traffic to high-value pages of the website. The SPH is now ranked in the first position for 18 high-value keywords in the Google search results within the Greater Boston area. It also secured several high-value, graphic-rich search results that increase brand awareness, demonstrate brand authority, and grow highly qualified organic traffic. Ultimately, our work with the SPH demonstrates the power of a holistic approach to SEO. Through our integrated threefold strategy, we maximized the School’s results and exponentially increased its visibility across all aspects of Google’s organic search results.

7.46%  increase in new visitors to the SPH website

“All of our interactions with the Carnegie team—from brand launch and development to launch of program-specific marketing—have been fantastic. Extending our team through Carnegie has positioned us better for our awareness and enrollment goals. Customer service, patience, responsiveness, talent—it’s all there with Carnegie.”
Chris TiptonInterim Director, Marketing & Communications

38
The University of Missouri System needed a comprehensive marketing strategy to unify online learning efforts across four System Universities and establish a strong system-wide brand for online education. Seeking a partner with higher education expertise, a data-driven approach, and comprehensive enrollment marketing capabilities, the System chose Carnegie through a competitive RFP process.
Telling a unified story: In its partnership with Carnegie, Missouri Online has unified and strengthened online learning efforts and developed a strong System-wide brand.

39
The Strategy
Our work started with building a cohesive System brand while acknowledging and preserving any established identities of each of the System Universities. Rooted in this research, Carnegie delivered brand architecture for a unified Missouri Online message to provide clarity and facilitate stronger awareness and enrollment growth. This architecture established a foundation for the development of naming recommendations, logos, campaign concepts, and an on-campus multimedia shoot. Carnegie also delivered custom audience segmentation the University has applied across marketing, including landing pages to tag personalized prospective student communication. We have since launched digital strategies primarily focused on building brand awareness, generating inquiries, and boosting application volume. Tactics include Display, social and streaming media, Search Engine Marketing, Search Engine Optimization, Google Analytics, and our proprietary Carnegie Clarity™ service, which tracks individual user activity throughout the enrollment funnel and personalizes experiences based on each user’s unique interests and actions.
The ResultsArmed with tools to speak with one voice across audiences, Missouri Online has unified its messaging across digital and print marketing, public relations, web, and more. Missouri Online has seen data that demonstrates an increase in brand lift, and many program-specific campaigns are seeing higher enrollment. Through Google’s Looker Studio dashboard, roughly 6,000 inquiries and 4,000 submitted applications were attributed to Carnegie digital campaigns in just nine months, with a notably low cost per conversion.

Wake Forest University
School of Business
40
When Wake Forest University needed strategic direction and management of digital marketing for its graduate business programs, the University selected Carnegie through a competitive bid process. With limited in-house marketing capabilities, the University needed a partner with a higher education focus as well as systems and processes in place to efficiently and effectively strategize and buy advertising on a national scale. There was also an expressed need to better understand and track prospective students throughout the enrollment journey and minimize “ghost” applicants.
“We are fully convinced that Carnegie’s digital strategies helped us meet or exceed our enrollment goals this year. We consistently find anywhere from a third to half of our enrolled students actively engaged with our digital campaigns during their search.”
Michael Lamphier
Executive Director, Marketing and Communication
Wake Forest University School of Business

41
The Strategy
To achieve Wake Forest’s primary goals of solidifying brand awareness and building the school’s profile, Carnegie delivered a layered digital strategy incorporating PPC, Display Outreach and Retargeting, and LinkedIn. Through Carnegie ClarityTM, Wake Forest was able to build an understanding of engagement (number of visits, engagement during site visits, etc.) among prospective students. Campaigns took an always-on approach with an emphasis in September and January in order to reach prospective students set to complete their undergraduate degrees. The initial media strategy was outlined based on Wake Forest’s goal to drive a balance of inquiries and applications. After a few months of optimizing campaign performance to those strategies driving inquiries most affordably (mostly Lead Generation campaigns on Facebook and Instagram), we gained more robust data from Carnegie ClarityTM that indicated while PPC had a higher cost per lead due to higher competition, PPC was actually most effective at driving application submissions. Our team then made a recommendation to shift more budget to PPC, where there was an opportunity to increase traffic and overall applications.
The ResultsAfter implementing a robust digital strategy inclusive of paid media, SEO, attribution through Carnegie ClarityTM and Google Analytics consulting, we effectively optimized campaign performance to outperform Carnegie benchmarks in nearly every category, including cost per acquisition (CPA). During the 2019–2020 fiscal year, Carnegie campaigns drove over 1,700 total conversions, with nearly 450 of those conversion actions being application submissions. The School of Business met or exceeded all enrollment goals for fall 2020, citing digital marketing as a significant factor in its success.

ManhattanvilleCollege
 “Carnegie is a large company that understands the value in each client thus making it feel like you are working with a small company that is fully invested in your success. Having worked with their teams based in different areas throughout the mid-Atlantic region, I can say that my experience has been nothing less than exceptional with each partnership. Their team members are subject matter experts that aren’t focused on “getting the big contract” but instead take the time to develop strategies for short- and long-term growth, that can also be adjusted in a timely manner if needed. I look forward to continuing our partnership for years to come.” 

Troy CogburnVice President for Enrollment and Marketing, 
Manhattanville College
30%increase in applications and admits
60%increase in new student deposits

43
The Situation
Manhattanville College needed a comprehensive strategic marketing partner across digital and Slate services. The College had worked with Carnegie in smaller capacities but launched a fully integrated partnership in 2021.

The Strategy
Following an in-depth discovery process around their target audiences and goals, we launched a comprehensive undergraduate-focused enrollment marketing plan in fall 2021. Strategies included Display Retargeting, social media, paid search, IP Targeting, and Search Engine Optimization. We also worked with Manhattanville for Slate communications and optimization, ensuring the College was leveraging the CRM to its full potential in tandem with digital strategies. Our recommendations for Manhattanville focused on maximizing its opportunities as a small college in a competitive market. 

The ResultsDuring the last two years, Manhattanville has seen increases in all areas of the first-year enrollment funnel, including a more than 30% increase in applications and admits, and more than 60% increase in new student deposits. We are proud to serve as ongoing trusted partners across our full suite of services.
