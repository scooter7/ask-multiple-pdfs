Bot: I'm sorry, but based on the provided context, there is no specific information about pricing, timelines, or a comprehensive approach to offering advertising and marketing services. The documents mainly outline the services provided by the company, such as market research, advertising conception, media buying, graphic design, and photography, but do not go into detail about pricing or timelines for these services. Additionally, there is no mention of specific citations or links to original documents for verification. If you need further assistance or more specific information, I recommend reaching out directly to the company or referring to any additional documents that may contain the details you are looking for.
