User: we don't have any creative services in the Undergrad folder? including keywords: digital marketing. The goal is to leverage content from the selected Grad or Undergrad folder to match these keywords and pull contextually relevant information from the folder contents, including in-depth scope of work and pricing when available.

Bot: I'm sorry, but I don't have the specific information about creative services related to the Undergrad folder or the availability of content matching the keywords "digital marketing." It seems like you might need to review the contents of the folders directly to find the relevant information you are seeking.
