Bot: I'm sorry, but the provided context does not contain any specific information regarding pricing, timelines, or a detailed proposal for the requested services. It mainly outlines the scope of professional services that could be provided, such as market research, advertising, graphic design, and social media. 

The information also mentions a proposed budget, internal brand consensus, discovery, executive interviews, and a strategy for student search solutions. However, there is no specific breakdown of pricing or timelines provided in the context.
