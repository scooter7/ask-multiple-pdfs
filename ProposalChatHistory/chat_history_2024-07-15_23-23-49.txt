424THE STORY 
Northeast Community 
College, situated in 
Norfolk, NE, currently 
serves 6,541 credit 
students. The College 
experienced a decline 
in enrollment and had 
been unsuccessful with 
past vendors. Further, 
the web traffic 
observed by the 
College’s CIO did not 
align with the reports 
provided to the 
Marketing Director by 
their digital marketing 
vendor. It was time for 
a change. 
THE STRATEGY 
The College 
collaborated with 
CLARUS on a 
comprehensive plan, 
incorporating Google 
AdWords; keyword 
retargeting; 
advertising on Spotify, 
Pandora, and 
iHeartRadio; CTV/OTT, 
micro-targeting; social 
media ads; and various 
programmatic tactics 
like geofencing and 
behavioral targeting. 
THE RESULTS activities. Typically includes working with your team on server redirect conﬁguration, sitemap 
and SEO conﬁguration, and submission of re-crawl requests to popular search engines.
