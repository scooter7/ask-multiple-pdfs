Bot: I'm sorry, but based on the provided context, there is no specific information or document regarding the pricing, fee structure, or detailed budget information for the digital marketing services proposed for Shasta College. The proposal mentions the approach to the project, steps involved, campaign optimization, real-time reporting, and team structure, but does not provide detailed pricing information or a specific fee structure.

For more detailed information on pricing and budget details, I recommend reaching out to Kristy Phillips, the Senior Director of Client Success at CLARUS, whose contact information is provided in the proposal. You can inquire directly about the pricing and fee structure for the digital marketing services offered to Shasta College.

If there are specific documents provided in the RFP that contain the information you are looking for, please refer to sections like "Cost Worksheet/Proposal" from Section 5 or "State Contract" from Section 7 of the RFP for more detailed information on pricing and budget.

If you need further assistance or clarification, feel free to reach out to the provided contact person or refer to the original documents for verification.
