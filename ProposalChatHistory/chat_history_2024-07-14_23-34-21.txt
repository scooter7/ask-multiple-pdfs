User: Question: portal

Context: You want a site that is robust, flexible, and adaptable as the College and its brand evolve. Additionally, you’re concerned that WordPress is not the best-fit long-term platform for your needs, but have little appetite at this time to be the trailblazer for a new platform

Drilling down into these areas, we gained even more context:
The Warrington website is viewed primarily as a marketing tool for prospective students, and graduate recruiting is the top priority.
The website has grown to ~3,000 pages, and you see an opportunity to simplify and streamline the site to ~500 pages. And then, to establish stronger centralized controls to ward off future sprawl.
The university brand has recently evolved, and the team sees opportunity to leverage UF brand attributes to better tell its story. SLATE PORTALS AND DATA VISUALIZATION
