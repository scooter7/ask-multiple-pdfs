User: Question: financial aid optimization

Context: academic, ﬁnancial, and behavioral indicators, our team designs predictive models 
that assign a yield probability to each admitted student. We use those models and 
yield probabilities to determine the institutional aid award for each student that 
would maximize their contribution to net tuition revenue. We then layer in 
institutional goals and constraints until we achieve a grant and scholarship strategy 
that maximizes net tuition revenue alongside key indicators like headcount, 
discount rate, diversity, and access for lower income students. 
What you’ll gain: 
+A model and aid optimization strategy that is ﬂexible to adapt to new or 
changing resources. 
+An understanding of the most efficient way to utilize new scholarship resources. 
+An understanding of how to shift resources between merit- and need-based aid 
programs to ensure that the funds are helping move you toward meeting key 
enrollment goals. Our modeling process is designed to begin with net tuition revenue maximization before building in institutional goals and constraints. This approach acknowledges that 
the design and execution of an institutional aid strategy is often the product of a careful consideration of a number of different (sometimes competing) goals. For 
instance, institutions often wish to increase access for lower-income students like Pell Grant and state need-based grant recipients, although investments in 
institutional aid for the highest need populations often erode net tuition revenue. Our modeling and strategy building strikes a balance between those goals and 
constraints. 
During the model building and strategy design phases, we engage in an active and collaborative process with our clients, identifying key tradeoffs and prioritizing those in your admitted or enrolled class. 
Individual Financial Aid 
Money matters. It’s your number one yield 
tactic, which is why it ought to be precise. We 
deliver individual aid strategy–not only 
customized for your institution, but 
customized for every student. 
This is what we call data-driven 
decision making at its best.  We work to 
identify students who are most likely to 
apply, exactly what precise amount of 
aid an individual student needs to 
enroll, and who might need intervention 
in order to retain. This is where your 
Student Search strategy becomes your 
enrollment strategy, and you recruit to 
retain. YIELD AND

+Regular strategy meetings to run through scenarios with the live tools, discuss 
questions or proposals of aid reallocation, and rapidly show how shifting aid 
investments across different populations may contribute to meeting or 
exceeding enrollment goals.

Bot: Based on the context provided, the financial aid optimization project involves designing predictive models to determine the right institutional aid award for each admitted student to maximize net tuition revenue. The project also includes strategies to balance institutional goals and constraints such as increasing access for lower-income students while maintaining revenue. Additionally, the project aims to understand how to shift resources between merit- and need-based aid programs to achieve key enrollment goals. The approach involves a collaborative process with clients to identify tradeoffs and prioritize goals.
