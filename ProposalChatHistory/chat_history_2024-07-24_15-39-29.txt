50We begin working on governance during the Deﬁne 
stage of our process. At the outset, we’ll identify 
opportunities to create new policies or update 
existing ones based on our discussions and 
planning sessions. 
We’ll then revisit the topic of governance once 
we’ve made decisions about content strategy, 
information architecture, and visual design. 
We’ll make recommendations for improvements 
and additions to your existing policies based on 
our discoveries and help you socialize the policies,

and those who’ll need to enforce them. Highlights of Our Approach
