Bot: I'm sorry, but based on the available documents and information provided, there is no specific past approach or detailed information regarding digital marketing services, website design, strategy, pricing, or timelines. The documents mainly focus on services offered such as website design, SEO, social media, and student search solutions, but do not provide explicit details on past approaches or comprehensive responses to digital marketing services. 

If you need more specific information or details on digital marketing services, I recommend reaching out directly to the organization or individual who provided these documents for further clarification and details on their past approaches to offering the requested services.
