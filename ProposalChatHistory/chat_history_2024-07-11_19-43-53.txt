Bot: I'm sorry, but based on the provided context, there is no specific information available regarding pricing and timelines for digital marketing services. The documents mention the cost of digital marketing services, such as a digital marketing strategy and execution for $100,000 annually. However, there are no detailed breakdowns of pricing or timelines provided in the context.

If you need more detailed information on pricing and timelines for specific digital marketing services, I recommend reaching out directly to the relevant service providers or agencies mentioned in the documents for a customized proposal that aligns with your requirements.
