User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of them parallel what in-person students utilize, however, the way those services are prioritized will be slightly different. Online students rely heavily on technology, so 24/7 technical support is crucial. They also need access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles for completing assignments effectively. Additionally, online students may require additional academic support, such as virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely, to ensure progress towards degree completion. Providing accessibility services, facilitating communication among students and instructors, and organizing virtual events are also important best practices to engage online students and promote a sense of community.
