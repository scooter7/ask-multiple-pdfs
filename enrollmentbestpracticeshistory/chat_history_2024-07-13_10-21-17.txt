User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these services parallel what in-person students utilize, but the prioritization may be slightly different. Here are some best practices for online students:

1. Ensure there is 24/7 technical support for quick resolution of any technical issues with the Learning Management System (LMS), software, or access.
2. Provide access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles for effective completion of assignments.
3. Offer virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions remotely to assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals.
4. Make sure there are accessibility services available, such as accommodations for screen reader capabilities, captioning, and alternative exam formats.
5. Create an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements and interactive online simulations to make the learning experience engaging and dynamic.
6. Facilitate communication and encourage regular interaction among students and instructors through discussion forums, check-in videos, and messaging platforms.
7. Organize virtual events, guest lectures, or webinars on topics related to student interest to engage students and foster a sense of community.
