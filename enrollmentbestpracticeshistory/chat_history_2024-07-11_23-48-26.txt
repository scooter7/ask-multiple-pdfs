User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. They rely heavily on technology, so 24/7 technical support is crucial. Access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is necessary for completing assignments effectively. Virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can offer guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. Creating an interactive learning environment, facilitating communication, encouraging regular interaction among students and instructors, establishing peer support networks, organizing virtual events, and providing prompt responses to inquiries can all enhance engagement and foster a sense of community among online students.
