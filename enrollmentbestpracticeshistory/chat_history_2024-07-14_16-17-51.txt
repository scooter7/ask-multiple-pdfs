User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these parallel what in-person students utilize, but the prioritization may be slightly different for online students. Here are some best practices for online students:

1. Ensure there is a coordinated student financial services center for assistance with important dates, financial aid, and payment options.
2. Provide 24/7 technical support for any technical issues with the Learning Management System (LMS) or software.
3. Offer access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles for completing assignments effectively.
4. Provide virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions for guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals.
5. Ensure accessibility services are available, such as accommodations for screen reader capabilities and alternative exam formats.
6. Create an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements and interactive online simulations to make the learning experience engaging.
7. Facilitate communication and interaction among students and instructors through discussion forums, check-in videos, and messaging platforms.
8. Encourage peer support networks or study groups for collaboration and academic support.
9. Organize virtual events, guest lectures, or webinars to engage students and foster a sense of community.

These practices can help online students succeed academically and feel supported throughout their educational journey.
