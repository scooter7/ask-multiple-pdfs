Bot: Graduate student populations are characterized by individuals who have completed their undergraduate degrees and are pursuing advanced studies at the graduate level. These students are typically older and more experienced than traditional undergraduates and may have specific career goals in mind. Graduate students often expect a higher level of academic rigor and may prioritize return on investment in their educational choices. Some graduate students may have work experience and may be pursuing further education to advance their careers. The enrollment goals for graduate student populations may focus on attracting experienced professionals seeking to enhance their skills and knowledge. Additionally, graduate student populations may have specific needs related to program timelines and deadlines, as well as potential benefits such as tuition remission from partnerships with local companies.
