User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have already completed an undergraduate degree and are pursuing advanced studies at the postgraduate level. These students tend to be more focused and specialized in their areas of interest compared to undergraduate students. Graduate students may have different academic needs and expectations, such as more precise academic language and a greater emphasis on return on investment. Additionally, graduate student enrollment goals and characteristics may vary depending on the institution and the specific program.
