User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. They heavily rely on technology, so having 24/7 technical support is crucial for resolving any technical issues with the Learning Management System (LMS), software, or access quickly. Access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is also essential for completing assignments effectively. Online students may require additional academic support, such as virtual tutoring services and remote academic advising sessions, to ensure they are making progress towards degree completion. Additionally, creating an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements and facilitating communication among students and instructors through discussion forums, check-in videos, and messaging platforms can promote engagement and a sense of community. Organizing virtual events, peer support networks, and providing prompt responses from instructors are also effective practices to engage online students.
