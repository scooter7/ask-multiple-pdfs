User: What are our print best practices?

Bot: Our print best practices include targeting print pieces to parents or guardians to address their concerns such as financial aid, safety, and ROI. Additionally, sending print pieces to families of students can help connect with parents about what matters to them. Print materials can be a great way to communicate important information to parents and guardians.
