User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these services parallel what in-person students utilize, but the prioritization may be slightly different for online students. Some best practices for online students include:

- Providing 24/7 technical support to ensure quick resolution of any technical issues with the Learning Management System (LMS), software, or access.
- Offering access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles to help students complete assignments effectively.
- Providing virtual tutoring services and remote academic advising sessions to offer guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals.
- Ensuring availability of accessibility services, such as accommodations for screen reader capabilities, captioning, and alternative exam formats.
- Creating an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements and interactive online simulations to make the learning experience engaging and dynamic.
- Facilitating communication and regular interaction among students and instructors through discussion forums, check-in videos, and messaging platforms.
- Building peer support networks or study groups to help students collaborate, share resources, and support each other academically and socially.
- Organizing virtual events, guest lectures, or webinars on topics of student interest to engage with experts, scholars, and peers.

These practices can help online students stay engaged, connected, and supported throughout their academic journey.
