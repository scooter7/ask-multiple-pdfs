User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations may have different characteristics compared to other groups. Some key differential factors include: the expectation of more precise academic language than traditional undergraduates, a focus on Return on Investment (ROI), different timelines and deadlines for admission decisions, and unique needs for transfer credit evaluations. Additionally, some graduate students may be traditional first-year aged individuals who attend community college for a smoother transition to college life.
