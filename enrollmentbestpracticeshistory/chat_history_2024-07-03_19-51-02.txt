User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have completed their undergraduate studies and are pursuing advanced degrees, such as master's or doctoral degrees. These students are usually older than traditional undergraduates and often have work experience. Graduate students are more likely to be focused on research and have specific academic and career goals. Additionally, they may have different timelines and deadlines for applications and enrollment compared to undergraduate students.
