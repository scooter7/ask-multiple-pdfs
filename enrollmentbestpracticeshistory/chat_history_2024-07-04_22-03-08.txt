User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: The graduate student population typically consists of individuals who have already completed an undergraduate degree and are pursuing advanced studies in a specific field. Graduate students are often more focused on career advancement, research, or specialized knowledge in their chosen discipline. They may have different academic language expectations compared to traditional undergraduates and are likely to be more concerned about return on investment. Graduate students may have varying timelines and deadlines for admissions and enrollment, and some may have work partnerships for tuition remission benefits.
