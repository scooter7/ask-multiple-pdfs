User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations can vary, but some key differential characteristics within this group include:
- Expectation of more precise academic language than traditional undergraduates
- Increased focus on Return on Investment (ROI)
- Some students may be more traditionally aged, having gone to community college for easier transition to college life
- Different timelines and deadlines for admission decisions and application processes
- Spring transfer students often have expedited timelines for transfer credit evaluations
- Some graduate students may utilize tuition reimbursement benefits from partnerships with local companies, leading them to study part-time.
