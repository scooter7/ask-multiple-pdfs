Bot: Online students rely heavily on technology and benefit greatly from a range of support services. They require 24/7 technical support for any issues with the Learning Management System, software, or access. They need access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles. Additionally, they may require virtual tutoring services, academic advising sessions, and accessibility services. Engaging online students involves creating an interactive learning environment, facilitating communication, encouraging regular interaction among students and instructors, organizing virtual events, and ensuring prompt responses to inquiries.
