User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have already completed their undergraduate studies and are now pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral programs. These students are often more focused on specific academic interests and career goals than undergraduate students. Graduate students may also have more work experience and professional aspirations that drive their educational pursuits. They tend to have a higher level of academic maturity and may be more self-directed in their learning. Graduate student populations can vary in size and composition depending on the institution and the specific programs offered.
