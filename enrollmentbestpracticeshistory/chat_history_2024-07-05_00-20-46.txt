User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have already completed their undergraduate degrees and are pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral degrees. These students are often more focused on specific academic or career goals, and may be older and more experienced than traditional undergraduate students. Graduate students may have different academic needs and expectations compared to undergraduate students, and may require more specialized support and resources. They may also have different timelines and deadlines for admissions and enrollment.
