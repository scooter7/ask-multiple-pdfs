Bot: Graduate student populations can vary depending on the institution, but some key differential factors include:
- Graduate students are typically older and have already completed an undergraduate degree.
- They may have more work experience and are often seeking to advance their careers or specialize in a particular field.
- Graduate students may have different academic needs and expectations compared to undergraduate students.
- They are likely to be more focused on research, academic projects, and professional development.
- Graduate students may also have different financial considerations, as they may be more concerned with return on investment and career outcomes.
