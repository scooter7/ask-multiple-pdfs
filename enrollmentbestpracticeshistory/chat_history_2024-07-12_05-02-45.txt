User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of them parallel what in-person students utilize, however, the way those services are prioritized will be slightly different. Online students rely heavily on technology, so 24/7 technical support ensures quick resolution of any technical issues. Additionally, access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is essential for completing assignments effectively. Virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. Creating an interactive learning environment and facilitating communication among students and instructors can also enhance the online learning experience. Lastly, peer support networks, virtual events, and prompt responses from instructors can help build a sense of community and foster engagement among online students.
