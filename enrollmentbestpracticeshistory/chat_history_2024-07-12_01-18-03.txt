User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of them parallel what in-person students utilize, however, the way those services are prioritized will be slightly different. Online students rely heavily on technology. 24/7 technical support ensures that any technical issues with the Learning Management System (LMS), software, or access can be resolved quickly for them. This group of students will need access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles so that they can complete assignments effectively. At times, online students may require additional academic support to ensure they are making progress towards degree completion. Virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. One of the most important considerations is making sure there are accessibility services available. Provisioning accommodations for students with screen reader capabilities, captioning, alternative exam formats ensures that all students have equal access to educational/curriculum materials. Lastly, make sure there is a coordinated student financial services center that can answer questions related to important term start and end dates, financial aid assistance, and account balance payment options.
