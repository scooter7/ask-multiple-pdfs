User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations are characterized by individuals who have completed their undergraduate studies and are pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral degrees. These students are typically more focused on specific academic or professional goals and may have more precise academic language expectations than traditional undergraduate students. Additionally, graduate students may prioritize return on investment (ROI) considerations more than traditional students. Some graduate students may have prior work experience or may be returning to academia after a break, bringing diverse perspectives to their studies. Graduate student populations may have unique timelines and deadlines for admissions and enrollment, with some programs having expedited timelines for spring transfers.
