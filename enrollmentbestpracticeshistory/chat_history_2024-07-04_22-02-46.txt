User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have already completed a bachelor's degree and are pursuing advanced studies at the master's or doctoral level. These students are generally more focused on specific academic or professional goals and may have more work or life experience compared to undergraduate students. Graduate students often engage in research, teaching assistantships, or professional internships as part of their academic programs. They may have different needs and expectations compared to undergraduate students, such as a desire for more specialized academic support, mentorship, and networking opportunities. Graduate student populations can vary widely depending on the field of study and the specific graduate programs offered by an institution.
