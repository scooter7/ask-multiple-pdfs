User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations may differ from other groups in several ways. Some of the key characteristics within this group include a more focused academic language expectation, a greater emphasis on Return on Investment (ROI), and a mix of both traditional and non-traditional age students. Graduate students often have different timelines and deadlines compared to undergraduate students, with spring transfer students having an expedited timeline for transfer credit evaluations. Additionally, graduate students may be more likely to be part-time due to utilizing tuition reimbursement benefits from partnerships with local companies.
