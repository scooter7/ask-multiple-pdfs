User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these parallel what in-person students utilize, but the prioritization may be slightly different. Some best practices for online students include:

1. Providing 24/7 technical support for quick resolution of technical issues with the Learning Management System, software, or access.
2. Ensuring access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles for effective completion of assignments.
3. Offering virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions remotely to provide guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals.
4. Prioritizing accessibility services to accommodate students with screen reader capabilities, captioning, and alternative exam formats.
5. Creating an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements and interactive online simulations to enhance engagement.
6. Facilitating communication and regular interaction among students and instructors through discussion forums, check-in videos, and messaging platforms.
7. Promoting a sense of community through peer support networks, study groups, virtual events, guest lectures, and webinars on topics of interest.

These best practices can help online students succeed academically and feel supported throughout their educational journey.
