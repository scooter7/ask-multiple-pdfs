Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have completed their undergraduate studies and are pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral degrees. These students are usually older than traditional undergraduate students and are more focused on specific areas of study. Graduate students may have diverse backgrounds and experiences and are often more independent in their research and academic pursuits.
