User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of them parallel what in-person students utilize, however, the way those services are prioritized will be slightly different. Online students rely heavily on technology, so 24/7 technical support is crucial. They also need access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles to complete assignments effectively. Additionally, virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can provide guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. Lastly, making sure there are accessibility services available, such as accommodations for screen reader capabilities, captioning, and alternative exam formats, is important for ensuring all students have equal access to educational materials.
