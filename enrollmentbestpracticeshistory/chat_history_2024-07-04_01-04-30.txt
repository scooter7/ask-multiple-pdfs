User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have completed their undergraduate studies and are pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral programs. These students are often more focused on specific career goals and may have more work experience compared to undergraduate students. They tend to seek opportunities for research, professional development, and specialized training within their chosen field of study. Graduate students may have different academic needs and expectations compared to undergraduate students, and institutions often provide tailored support services to meet those needs.
