User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these services parallel what in-person students utilize, but the prioritization may be slightly different for online students. Some of the best practices for online students include:

1. Ensuring 24/7 technical support for quick resolution of any technical issues with the Learning Management System (LMS), software, or access.
2. Providing access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles for effective completion of assignments.
3. Offering virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions remotely to assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals.
4. Prioritizing accessibility services to ensure all students have equal access to educational materials, such as screen reader capabilities, captioning, and alternative exam formats.
5. Creating an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements and interactive online simulations to make the learning experience engaging and dynamic.
6. Facilitating communication and encouraging regular interaction among students and instructors through discussion forums, check-in videos, and messaging platforms.
7. Building peer support networks or study groups to help students collaborate, share resources, and support each other academically and socially.
8. Organizing virtual events, guest lectures, or webinars on topics of student interest to provide a forum for online students to engage with experts, network with peers, and feel a part of institutional events while not on campus.
