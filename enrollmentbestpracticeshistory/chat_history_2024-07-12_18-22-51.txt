User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these services parallel what in-person students utilize, but the prioritization may be slightly different. Here are some best practices for online students:
1. Ensure there is 24/7 technical support for any technical issues with the Learning Management System (LMS), software, or access.
2. Provide access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles for effective completion of assignments.
3. Offer virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions remotely for guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals.
4. Prioritize accessibility services to accommodate students with screen reader capabilities, captioning, and alternative exam formats.
5. Promote engagement and a sense of community by creating an interactive learning environment, facilitating communication among students and instructors, and organizing virtual events, guest lectures, or webinars. 

These practices can help online students succeed in their academic endeavors.
