User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of them parallel what in-person students utilize, however, the way those services are prioritized will be slightly different. Online students heavily rely on technology, so 24/7 technical support ensures any technical issues with the Learning Management System (LMS), software, or access can be resolved quickly. They also need access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles to complete assignments effectively. Additionally, virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. Lastly, ensuring accessibility services are available is crucial for online students to have equal access to educational materials.
