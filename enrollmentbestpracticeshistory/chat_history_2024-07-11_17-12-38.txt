User: transfer student audiences

Bot: When marketing to transfer student audiences, it's important to consider their unique characteristics and needs. Transfer students are often intentional with their search, looking to maximize credit transfer opportunities. They may be more focused on ROI, have specific questions, and prefer speaking with a person rather than being bombarded with emails. It's crucial to focus on transferability and cost, provide flexibility in course offerings, highlight campus support services, and connect them with current students or graduates with successful stories. Additionally, promoting transfer credit evaluation solutions and transfer-specific scholarships could help identify and attract transfer students early in the process.
