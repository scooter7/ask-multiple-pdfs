User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations are characterized by a few key factors. They are typically older and more experienced in academia compared to traditional undergraduate students. Graduate students often have a more focused area of study and career goals. They may have higher expectations for academic rigor and may be more concerned with the return on investment in their education. Additionally, the timeline for graduate student admissions and enrollment may differ from that of undergraduate students, with various deadlines and processes to consider.
