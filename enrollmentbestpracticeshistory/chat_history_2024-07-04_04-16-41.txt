User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations can vary significantly from undergraduate student populations. They may include students who have already completed a bachelor's degree and are pursuing advanced studies in a specific field. Some key differential characteristics of graduate students include a higher level of academic language proficiency, a focus on return on investment (ROI), and potentially different timelines for application and admission processes. Graduate students may also have specific expectations regarding academic rigor and professional development opportunities. Additionally, partnerships with local companies offering tuition remission benefits may attract graduate students who are working professionals seeking to further their education part-time.
