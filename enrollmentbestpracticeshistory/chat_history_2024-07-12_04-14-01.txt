User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. It's important to create an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements to make the learning experience engaging. Facilitating communication and encouraging regular interaction among students and instructors through discussion forums, check-in videos, and messaging platforms is key. Providing 24/7 technical support, access to digital libraries, research databases, and academic journal articles is essential. Offering virtual tutoring services, academic advising sessions, and accommodating accessibility services are also important practices for online students. Additionally, organizing virtual events, guest lectures, or webinars can help students feel engaged and part of an online community.
