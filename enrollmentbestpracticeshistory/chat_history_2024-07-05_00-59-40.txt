User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations are a distinct group within higher education. Some key differential characteristics of graduate students include being more focused on Return on Investment (ROI), having a more precise understanding of academic language, and often having different timelines and deadlines for admissions compared to traditional undergraduates. Additionally, some transfer students may also fall into the graduate student population, especially those who are more traditionally aged for first-year students. Graduate students typically seek advanced knowledge and opportunities for specialization within their chosen field of study.
