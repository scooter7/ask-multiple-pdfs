User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations can vary significantly from undergraduate populations. Some key differential factors may include the fact that graduate students are typically older, have more work or life experience, and are often more focused on specific career goals. Graduate students may also have different academic expectations and may be more concerned with return on investment (ROI) in terms of their education. Additionally, graduate students may have different timelines and deadlines for admissions and enrollment compared to undergraduate students.
