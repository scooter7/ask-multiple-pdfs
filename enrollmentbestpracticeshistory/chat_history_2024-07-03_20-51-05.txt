User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations are characterized by individuals who have already completed an undergraduate degree and are pursuing further education at a higher level. Some key differential factors for graduate students include a higher level of academic language proficiency, a focus on return on investment (ROI), and differing timelines and deadlines for admission and enrollment. Additionally, some graduate students may be older and have work experience, leading to a different perspective on their educational goals. Graduate student populations may also have specific needs and expectations related to research opportunities, faculty interactions, and career advancement.
