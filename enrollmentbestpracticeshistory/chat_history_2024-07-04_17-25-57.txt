User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have completed their undergraduate studies and are pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral degrees. These students are often older than traditional undergraduate students, have more work experience, and may have different academic needs and expectations. Graduate students may have specific research interests and career goals that drive their academic pursuits. They may also have different financial considerations and may be more focused on return on investment (ROI) in terms of their education. Additionally, graduate students may have different deadlines and timelines for application processes compared to undergraduate students.
