User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of them parallel what in-person students utilize, however, the way those services are prioritized will be slightly different. Online students rely heavily on technology. 24/7 technical support ensures that any technical issues with Learning Management Systems (LMS), software, or access can be resolved quickly for them. This group of students will need access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles so that they can complete assignments effectively. At times, online students may require additional academic support to ensure they are making progress towards degree completion. Virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. One of the most important considerations is making sure there are accessibility services available, such as accommodations for students with screen reader capabilities, captioning, and alternative exam formats, to ensure equal access to educational materials. Lastly, having a coordinated student financial services center that can answer questions related to important term dates, financial aid assistance, and payment options is crucial for online students.
