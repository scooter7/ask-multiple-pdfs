User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of them parallel what in-person students utilize, however, the way those services are prioritized will be slightly different. Online students rely heavily on technology, so 24/7 technical support is crucial. They also need access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles to complete assignments effectively. Additionally, virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. Provisioning accommodations for accessibility services is also essential to ensure all students have equal access to educational materials. Lastly, engaging online students can be achieved by creating an interactive learning environment, facilitating communication and regular interaction among students and instructors, promoting peer support networks, and organizing virtual events or webinars related to student interests.
