User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these services parallel what in-person students utilize, but the way they are prioritized will be slightly different for online students. It's essential to provide 24/7 technical support to resolve any issues with the Learning Management System, software, or access quickly. Online students will also need access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles to complete assignments effectively. Additionally, virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. Lastly, ensuring accessibility services are available, such as accommodations for screen reader capabilities and alternative exam formats, is crucial for online students.
