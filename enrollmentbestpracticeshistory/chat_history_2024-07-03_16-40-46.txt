User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have already completed a bachelor's degree and are pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral degrees. They are often older and more experienced than undergraduate students, with a focus on specialized fields of study or research. Graduate students may have higher expectations for academic rigor and outcomes, as well as specific career goals. They may also have different timelines and deadlines for admissions and enrollment compared to undergraduate students. Additionally, some graduate students may be part-time students, balancing their studies with work or other commitments.
