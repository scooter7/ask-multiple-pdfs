Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have completed their undergraduate studies and are pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral degrees. Some key characteristics of graduate students include a higher level of academic maturity, a greater focus on research and specialized knowledge in their fields, and a higher level of independence in their academic pursuits. Graduate students often have a more specific career or academic goal in mind compared to undergraduate students. Additionally, graduate students may have different timelines and deadlines for applications and enrollment, and they may also have different financial considerations, such as seeking funding through research assistantships or grants.
