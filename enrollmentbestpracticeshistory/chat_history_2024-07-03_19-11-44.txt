User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have completed a bachelor's degree and are pursuing advanced studies in a specific field. They tend to be older than traditional undergraduate students, ranging from mid-20s to even beyond 30 years old. Graduate students are often more focused and driven, as they have a clearer idea of their academic and career goals. They may have work experience or other commitments, which can influence their study habits and schedules. Additionally, graduate students may have more specific research interests and require a higher level of academic support or resources.
