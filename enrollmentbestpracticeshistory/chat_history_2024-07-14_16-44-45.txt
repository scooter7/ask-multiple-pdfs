User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these services parallel what in-person students utilize, but the prioritization may be slightly different. Online students heavily rely on technology, so 24/7 technical support is crucial for resolving any technical issues quickly. Additionally, access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is essential for completing assignments effectively. Virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can also assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. Lastly, ensuring accessibility services are available and providing accommodations for students with various needs is important.
