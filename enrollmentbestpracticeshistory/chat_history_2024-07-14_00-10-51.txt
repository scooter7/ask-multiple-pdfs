User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. These services include 24/7 technical support for any issues related to the Learning Management System (LMS), software, or access. Additionally, online students need access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles to complete assignments effectively. Virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can also provide guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. It is important to ensure that there are accessibility services available for online students, such as accommodations for screen reader capabilities, captioning, and alternative exam formats. Lastly, creating an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements and facilitating communication through discussion forums and messaging platforms can help promote engagement and a sense of community among online students.
