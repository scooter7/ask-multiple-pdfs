User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations are characterized by individuals who have already completed an undergraduate degree and are pursuing advanced studies in a specific field. They tend to be more focused on their academic and career goals, with a higher level of academic language proficiency compared to traditional undergraduates. Graduate students may have different timelines and deadlines for admissions compared to undergraduates, with some spring transfer students having expedited timelines. Additionally, graduate students may have a greater emphasis on return on investment (ROI) and may be more likely to be part-time students, especially if they are utilizing tuition reimbursement benefits from local companies.
