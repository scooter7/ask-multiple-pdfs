User: What should I know about traditional student populations?

Bot: Traditional student populations are typically made up of first-year students who enroll directly from high school. They are usually younger in age and have limited experience with higher education. Traditional students are looking for a full college experience, including campus life and extracurricular activities. They may require more guidance and support in their transition to college. Financial considerations are important for traditional students and their families. It's important to understand their needs, preferences, and expectations when creating enrollment strategies or marketing to them.
