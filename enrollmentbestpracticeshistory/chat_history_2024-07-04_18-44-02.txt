User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: The graduate student population typically consists of individuals who have completed their undergraduate degrees and are pursuing advanced studies in a specific field or discipline. They are generally older and more experienced in academia compared to undergraduate students. Graduate students often have specific career or research goals that they are working towards. Additionally, graduate students may have different timelines and deadlines for applications and admissions processes compared to undergraduate students. It is also worth noting that some graduate students may be part-time due to work or family commitments.
