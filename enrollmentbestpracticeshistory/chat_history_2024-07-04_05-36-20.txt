User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have completed their undergraduate studies and are pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral programs. They are usually older than traditional undergraduate students, with more focused career goals. Graduate students may have more work or research experience, and they often have specific academic or professional interests. Graduate student populations can vary in size and diversity depending on the institution and the programs offered.
