User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these services parallel what in-person students utilize, however, the way those services are prioritized will be slightly different. Online students heavily rely on technology, so 24/7 technical support is crucial. They also need access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles. Additionally, offering virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions remotely can assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. Lastly, ensuring there are accessibility services available is essential for online students to have equal access to educational materials.
