User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations are characterized by individuals who have completed their undergraduate studies and are pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral degrees. Some key differential factors for graduate students include their focus on specific academic disciplines, higher levels of academic and research rigor, and often a more mature and focused approach to their studies compared to undergraduate students. Graduate students may also have different needs and expectations, such as a greater emphasis on research opportunities, networking with professionals in their field, and career advancement. Graduate student populations vary in terms of enrollment goals, and institutions may need to tailor their approaches to recruitment, admissions, and support services to meet the unique needs of this group.
