User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of them parallel what in-person students utilize, however, the way those services are prioritized will be slightly different. Online students rely heavily on technology, so 24/7 technical support ensures that any technical issues with the Learning Management System, software, or access can be resolved quickly for them. Access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, academic journal articles, virtual tutoring services, and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can also assist students with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. Lastly, ensuring there are accessibility services available, such as accommodations for screen readers, captioning, and alternative exam formats, is crucial for providing equal access to educational materials.
