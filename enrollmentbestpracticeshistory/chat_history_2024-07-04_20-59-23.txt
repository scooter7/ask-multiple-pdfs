User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations are characterized by individuals who have already completed their undergraduate studies and are pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral degrees. These students are typically more focused on specific academic or professional goals and may have a higher level of academic language proficiency compared to traditional undergraduates. Graduate students often have different timelines and deadlines for admissions, especially for spring transfers. Additionally, graduate students may prioritize return on investment considerations more than traditional first-year students. Some graduate students may also be part-time, especially if they are utilizing tuition reimbursement benefits from local companies.
