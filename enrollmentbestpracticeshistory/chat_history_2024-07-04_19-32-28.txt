Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have completed their undergraduate studies and are pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral degrees. These students are usually older and more experienced in academia compared to undergraduate students. They may have specific research interests and career goals that drive their decision to pursue graduate education. Graduate students often engage in research, thesis or dissertation projects, and other specialized coursework related to their field of study. Additionally, graduate students may have different financial considerations, such as seeking assistantships or fellowships to support their education.
