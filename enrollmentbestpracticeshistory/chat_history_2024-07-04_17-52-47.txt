User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: The key differential characteristics of graduate student populations include the fact that they are typically older, have already completed an undergraduate degree, and are often more focused on career advancement or specialization in a particular field. Graduate students may have different expectations and needs compared to undergraduate students, such as more precise academic language and a focus on return on investment. Graduate student recruitment and support strategies may need to be tailored to address these unique characteristics.
