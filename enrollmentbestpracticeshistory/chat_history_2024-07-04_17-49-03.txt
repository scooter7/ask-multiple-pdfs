User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations are characterized by individuals who have completed a bachelor's degree and are pursuing advanced studies at the postgraduate level. Some key characteristics of graduate students include a higher level of academic maturity, a greater focus on research and specialized knowledge, and a more advanced understanding of their specific field of study compared to undergraduate students. Graduate students often have specific career goals in mind and may be looking to deepen their expertise or pursue opportunities in academia, research, or professional fields. Graduate student populations may have different enrollment goals and expectations compared to undergraduate students, and institutions may need to tailor their recruitment and support strategies to meet the needs of this group effectively.
