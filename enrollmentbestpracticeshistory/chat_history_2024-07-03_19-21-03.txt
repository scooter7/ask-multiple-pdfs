User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have already completed their undergraduate education and are pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral degrees. They tend to be more focused on specific career goals and academic interests, often with a higher level of academic maturity compared to undergraduate students. Graduate students may have varying levels of work experience, and they often place a significant emphasis on research, academic rigor, and professional development. Additionally, graduate students may have different financial considerations, such as funding opportunities, assistantships, and scholarships, compared to undergraduate students.
