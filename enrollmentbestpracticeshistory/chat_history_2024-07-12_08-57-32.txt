Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. They rely heavily on technology, so 24/7 technical support is crucial for resolving any technical issues quickly. Access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is essential for completing assignments effectively. Additionally, virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. Creating an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements, facilitating communication among students and instructors, and organizing virtual events or webinars are also effective practices to engage online students and promote a sense of community.
