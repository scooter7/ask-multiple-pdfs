User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. They rely heavily on technology, so having 24/7 technical support is crucial for resolving any issues quickly. Access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is also essential for completing assignments effectively. Additionally, virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. Prioritizing accessibility services and accommodations for students with different needs is important. 

To engage online students and promote a sense of community, creating an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements, facilitating communication through discussion forums and messaging platforms, and organizing virtual events or webinars related to student interests are recommended. Prompt responses from instructors on inquiries, peer support networks, and virtual study groups can also help build a sense of community and foster belonging among online students.
