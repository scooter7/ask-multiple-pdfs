User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many services parallel what in-person students utilize, but the prioritization may be slightly different. Online students rely heavily on technology, so 24/7 technical support ensures that any technical issues with the Learning Management System (LMS), software, or access can be resolved quickly for them. Access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is essential for completing assignments effectively. Additionally, online students may need virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely to ensure they are making progress towards degree completion. It's also important to provide accessibility services and accommodations for students with different needs. Lastly, creating an interactive learning environment and facilitating communication and interaction among students and instructors can promote engagement and a sense of community.
