User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of them parallel what in-person students utilize, however, the way those services are prioritized will be slightly different. Here are some best practices for online students:

1. Ensure 24/7 technical support for quick resolution of any technical issues with the Learning Management System, software, or access.
2. Provide access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles for effective completion of assignments.
3. Offer virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely to assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals.
4. Ensure accessibility services are available, such as accommodations for screen reader capabilities, captioning, and alternative exam formats for equal access to educational materials.
5. Create an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements and interactive online simulations to make the learning experience engaging and dynamic.
6. Facilitate communication and encourage regular interaction among students and instructors through discussion forums, check-in videos, and messaging platforms.
7. Organize virtual events, guest lectures, or webinars to provide online students with opportunities to engage with experts, scholars, and peers.

These practices can help online students succeed academically and feel connected to their learning community.
