User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: The graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have already completed their undergraduate studies and are pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral degrees. Graduate students are often more focused on specific academic or professional goals, and may have different expectations and needs compared to undergraduate students. They may be more experienced in academic settings and have a higher level of subject matter expertise. Graduate students may also be balancing their studies with work or other responsibilities, so flexibility in program offerings and support services may be important for this group.
