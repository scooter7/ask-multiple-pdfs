User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations are typically characterized by students who have completed an undergraduate degree and are pursuing advanced studies at the postgraduate level. These students are often more focused on specific academic and career goals, and they may have a higher level of academic language proficiency compared to traditional undergraduate students. Graduate students are usually older, more experienced, and may have work or research experience in their field of study. They may also have different timelines and deadlines for admissions and enrollment compared to undergraduate students. Additionally, some graduate students may be part-time, especially if they are working professionals or have other commitments.
