User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations are typically characterized by individuals who have completed a bachelor's degree and are pursuing advanced studies at the postgraduate level. These students are often older than traditional undergraduates and tend to have a stronger focus on their academic and career goals. Graduate students may have more specific academic interests and research goals compared to undergraduate students. It is also common for graduate students to have more work or life experience, which can influence their approach to education. Additionally, graduate students may have different timelines and deadlines for applications and admissions compared to undergraduate students.
