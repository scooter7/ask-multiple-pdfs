Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. They heavily rely on technology, so 24/7 technical support is essential. Additionally, access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is crucial for completing assignments effectively. Online students may also need virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions to ensure they are making progress towards degree completion. Creating an interactive learning environment, facilitating communication, encouraging regular interaction among students and instructors, building peer support networks, and organizing virtual events are all best practices to engage online students and promote a sense of community.
