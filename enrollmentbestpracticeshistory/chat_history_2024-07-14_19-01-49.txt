User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these services parallel what in-person students utilize but are prioritized slightly differently for online students. Here are some best practices for online students: 

1. Ensure access to technology, including 24/7 technical support for any issues with the Learning Management System and software.
2. Provide access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles for completing assignments effectively.
3. Offer virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions remotely to assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals.
4. Ensure availability of accessibility services like screen reader capabilities, captioning, and alternative exam formats.
5. Create an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements to make the learning experience engaging and dynamic.
6. Facilitate communication and regular interaction among students and instructors through discussion forums, check-in videos, and messaging platforms.
7. Encourage peer support networks or study groups to help students collaborate and support each other academically and socially.
8. Organize virtual events, guest lectures, or webinars related to student interest to engage students and foster a sense of community.
