User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have completed an undergraduate degree and are pursuing advanced studies in a specific field. They are often older than traditional undergraduate students and have a higher level of academic experience. Graduate students may have specific interests or career goals that drive their studies, and they might be more focused on research and professional development. Graduate programs often require a higher level of academic rigor and research skills compared to undergraduate programs. It's also worth noting that graduate student populations can vary depending on the institution and the specific graduate programs offered.
