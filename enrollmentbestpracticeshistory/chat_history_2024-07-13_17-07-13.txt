User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online student best practices include creating an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements, facilitating communication and interaction among students and instructors through discussion forums and messaging platforms, providing 24/7 technical support, giving access to digital libraries and research databases, offering virtual tutoring and academic advising sessions, and organizing virtual events or webinars related to student interests. Additionally, peer support networks or study groups can help students collaborate and support each other academically and socially. Prompt responses from instructors on student inquiries are also important to promote active participation and build a sense of community.
