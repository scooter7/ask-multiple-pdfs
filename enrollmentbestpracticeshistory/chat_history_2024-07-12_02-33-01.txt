User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of them parallel what in-person students utilize, however, the way those services are prioritized will be slightly different. Online students heavily rely on technology, so 24/7 technical support is crucial to quickly resolve any technical issues with the Learning Management System (LMS), software, or access. Additionally, online students need access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles to complete assignments effectively. Providing virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions remotely can assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. It's also important to ensure there are accessibility services available, such as accommodations for screen reader capabilities, captioning, and alternative exam formats, to ensure all students have equal access to educational materials.
