User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. It is important to create an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements to make the learning experience engaging and dynamic. Facilitating communication and encouraging regular interaction among students and instructors through discussion forums, check-in videos, and messaging platforms is crucial. Providing 24/7 technical support, access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is essential. Virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can also assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. Additionally, creating peer support networks, organizing virtual events, guest lectures, or webinars, and ensuring quick responses from instructors can help build a sense of community and foster a sense of belonging among online students.
