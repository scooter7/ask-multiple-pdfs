Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have completed their undergraduate studies and are pursuing advanced degrees, such as master's or doctoral programs. These students tend to be more focused on specific academic disciplines and research areas compared to undergraduate students. Graduate students may also have varying levels of work experience and may be balancing academic studies with professional responsibilities. Additionally, graduate students often have different needs and expectations compared to undergraduate students, such as more specialized academic support and research opportunities.
