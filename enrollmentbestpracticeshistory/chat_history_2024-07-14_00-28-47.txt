User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these services parallel what in-person students utilize, but the prioritization may be slightly different for online students. Here are some best practices for online students:
1. Ensure access to technology and provide 24/7 technical support for quick issue resolution.
2. Provide access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles for effective completion of assignments.
3. Offer virtual tutoring services and remote academic advising for guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals.
4. Ensure availability of accessibility services such as screen reader capabilities, captioning, and alternative exam formats.
5. Create an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements to make the learning experience engaging and dynamic.
6. Facilitate communication and encourage regular interaction among students and instructors through discussion forums, check-in videos, and messaging platforms.
7. Establish peer support networks or study groups to help students collaborate, share resources, and support each other academically and socially.
8. Organize virtual events, guest lectures, or webinars on topics of student interest to foster engagement and a sense of community.
