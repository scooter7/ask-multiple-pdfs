User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services, including access to technology, 24/7 technical support for any issues with the Learning Management System or software, digital libraries, research databases, and academic journal articles for assignments. They may also need virtual tutoring services and academic advising for guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. To engage online students and promote a sense of community, creating an interactive learning environment, facilitating communication, encouraging regular interaction among students and instructors, providing prompt responses, establishing peer support networks or study groups, and organizing virtual events or webinars are key best practices.
