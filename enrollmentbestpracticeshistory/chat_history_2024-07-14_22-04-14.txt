User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these services parallel what in-person students utilize, but the way they are prioritized will be slightly different. Online students heavily rely on technology, so 24/7 technical support is crucial to resolve any issues with the Learning Management System (LMS), software, or access quickly. Access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is also essential. Additionally, online students may require academic support like virtual tutoring services and remote academic advising sessions for guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. It's important to ensure there are accessibility services available, and accommodations for screen reader capabilities, captioning, and alternative exam formats. Lastly, creating an interactive learning environment, facilitating communication among students and instructors, and building peer support networks are key practices to engage online students and promote a sense of community.
