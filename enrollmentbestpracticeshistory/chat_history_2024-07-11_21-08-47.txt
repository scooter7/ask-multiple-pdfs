User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. They rely heavily on technology, so 24/7 technical support is crucial for resolving any issues with the Learning Management System, software, or access quickly. Online students also need access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles to complete assignments effectively. Additionally, they may require virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions for guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. It's essential to ensure accessibility services are available and to prioritize communication, interaction, and engagement through various platforms to promote a sense of community among online students.
