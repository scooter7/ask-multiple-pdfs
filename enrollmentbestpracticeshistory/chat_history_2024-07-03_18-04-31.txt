User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations are characterized by several factors that differentiate them from other groups. These characteristics include a more mature age group, a focus on precise academic language, a stronger emphasis on return on investment (ROI), and diverse timelines and deadlines for admissions and credit evaluations. Additionally, some graduate students may have a traditional undergraduate background, while others might be working professionals seeking further education. Graduate student populations often have specific needs and expectations that institutions should consider when designing recruitment and retention strategies.
