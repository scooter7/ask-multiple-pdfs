User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. They heavily rely on technology, so 24/7 technical support is crucial for resolving any technical issues quickly. Access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is essential for completing assignments effectively. Online students may also require additional academic support through virtual tutoring services and remote academic advising sessions for guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. It's important to ensure that accessibility services are available to provide accommodations for all students. Creating an interactive learning environment, facilitating communication between students and instructors, building peer support networks, and organizing virtual events are also effective ways to engage online students and promote a sense of community.
