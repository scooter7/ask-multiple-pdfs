User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations often consist of individuals who have completed their undergraduate studies and are pursuing advanced degrees such as master's or doctoral programs. These students tend to be more focused on their academic and career goals, and may have a higher level of specialization in their chosen field compared to undergraduate students. Graduate students may also have different priorities and needs, such as research opportunities, funding, and career development support. The enrollment goals for graduate student populations may vary depending on the institution and program. Additionally, graduate students may have different timelines and deadlines for application processes compared to undergraduate students.
