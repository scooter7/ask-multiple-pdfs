User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have completed an undergraduate degree and are pursuing advanced studies in a specific field of interest. They are often older than traditional undergraduate students and may have more work or life experience. Graduate students tend to have a more focused academic interest and may require more precise academic language in their interactions. Additionally, the return on investment (ROI) is often a significant consideration for graduate students compared to traditional undergraduate students. Graduate student populations also may have different timelines and deadlines for admissions and enrollment, with some programs offering spring admissions in addition to the more common fall admissions.
