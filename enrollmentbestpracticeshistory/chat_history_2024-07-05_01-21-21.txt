User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have already completed an undergraduate degree and are pursuing advanced studies in a specific field. They are often more focused on specific career goals and research interests compared to undergraduate students. Graduate students may include those pursuing master's degrees, doctoral degrees, or other advanced professional degrees. The characteristics of graduate students may vary, but they generally tend to be more independent, self-motivated, and have a higher level of academic engagement. Graduate students may also have different needs and expectations compared to undergraduate students, such as more specialized academic support and research opportunities.
