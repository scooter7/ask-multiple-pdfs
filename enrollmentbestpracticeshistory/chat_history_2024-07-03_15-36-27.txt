User: What are our print best practices?

Bot: Print best practices for reaching parents/guardians include sending print pieces that address topics important to them, such as financial aid, safety, and ROI. Additionally, consider sending print materials addressed to "the family of [student's name]" to ensure that the information gets into the hands of at least one parent. Print is a great way to connect with parents/guardians about what matters to them.
