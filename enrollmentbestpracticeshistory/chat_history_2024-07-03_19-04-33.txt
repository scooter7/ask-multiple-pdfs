User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations are typically characterized by individuals who have already completed an undergraduate degree and are pursuing advanced studies in a specific field. They often have a more focused academic interest compared to undergraduate students and may be more research-oriented. Unlike traditional undergraduates, graduate students are more likely to be older, have professional work experience, and are generally more independent in their studies. Graduate students may have different needs and expectations compared to undergraduate students, such as a greater emphasis on research opportunities, mentorship, and networking. Additionally, graduate students may have different timelines and deadlines for admissions and enrollment, depending on the program and institution.
