User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these parallel what in-person students utilize, but the way those services are prioritized will be slightly different. Online students rely heavily on technology, so 24/7 technical support is crucial to resolving any technical issues with the Learning Management System, software, or access quickly. Additionally, access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is essential for completing assignments effectively. Virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions conducted remotely can assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. It's also crucial to ensure accessibility services are available. Creating an interactive learning environment, facilitating communication among students and instructors, providing prompt responses, establishing peer support networks, and organizing virtual events can also help engage online students and promote a sense of community.
