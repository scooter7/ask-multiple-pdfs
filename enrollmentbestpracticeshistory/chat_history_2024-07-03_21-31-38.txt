User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations have unique characteristics that differentiate them from other groups. These students are typically older and have already completed an undergraduate degree. They are often more focused on specific career goals and may be more experienced in their field. Graduate students may also expect a higher level of academic rigor and precision in language compared to traditional undergraduates. Additionally, the return on investment (ROI) for their education is likely to be a significant consideration for graduate students. Finally, there may be subsets within the graduate student population, such as those who are of traditional undergraduate age but have decided to attend graduate school after a short period in the workforce or community college.
