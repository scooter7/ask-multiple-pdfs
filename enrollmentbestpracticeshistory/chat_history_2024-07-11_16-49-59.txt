Bot: Online students will benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these services parallel what in-person students utilize, but the way they are prioritized will be slightly different. Online students rely heavily on technology, so 24/7 technical support is crucial to quickly resolve any technical issues with the Learning Management System, software, or access. Additionally, access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is essential for completing assignments effectively. Virtual tutoring services, academic advising sessions, and accessibility services should also be available to ensure that online students have the necessary support to progress towards degree completion. Facilitating communication and encouraging interaction among students and instructors, creating peer support networks, organizing virtual events, and providing financial services support are all ways to engage online students and promote a sense of community.
