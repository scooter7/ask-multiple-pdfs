User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. They heavily rely on technology, so 24/7 technical support is essential to resolve any technical issues with the Learning Management System, software, or access quickly. Access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is crucial for completing assignments effectively. Providing virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions remotely can also assist with guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. Additionally, creating an interactive learning environment, facilitating communication among students and instructors, organizing virtual events, and establishing peer support networks can help engage online students and promote a sense of community.
