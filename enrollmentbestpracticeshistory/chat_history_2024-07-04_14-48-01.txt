User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have completed an undergraduate degree and are pursuing advanced studies in their field of interest. These students are more focused on specialized knowledge and research within their discipline. Some key differential factors for graduate students may include a higher level of academic language proficiency, a stronger emphasis on return on investment (ROI), and varied timelines for application and enrollment, especially for spring transfer students. Additionally, graduate students may have different expectations and needs compared to traditional undergraduate students.
