User: Tell me about graduate student populations

Bot: Graduate student populations typically consist of individuals who have already completed an undergraduate degree and are pursuing advanced education in a specific field. These students are usually older and more focused on their academic and professional goals compared to undergraduate students. Graduate students often have a more precise academic language and expect a higher level of academic rigor. Additionally, graduate students may be more concerned with return on investment and career outcomes. The admission timelines and deadlines for graduate students can be different from those of undergraduate students, with some programs offering spring admissions with expedited evaluation processes.
