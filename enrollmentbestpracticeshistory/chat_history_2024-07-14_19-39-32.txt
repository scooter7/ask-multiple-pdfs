User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. Many of these services parallel what in-person students utilize, however, the way those services are prioritized will be slightly different for online students. Here are some best practices for online students:
1. Ensure 24/7 technical support for any technical issues with the Learning Management System, software, or access.
2. Provide access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles.
3. Offer virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions remotely.
4. Prioritize accessibility services to accommodate students with screen reader capabilities, captioning, and alternative exam formats.
5. Create an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements and interactive online simulations.
6. Facilitate communication and encourage regular interaction among students and instructors through discussion forums, check-in videos, and messaging platforms.
7. Organize virtual events, guest lectures, or webinars to engage students and promote a sense of community.
