User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services that parallel what in-person students utilize. Some best practices for online students include:
1. Creating an interactive learning environment with multimedia elements to make the learning experience more engaging and dynamic.
2. Facilitating communication and encouraging regular interaction among students and instructors through discussion forums, check-in videos, and messaging platforms.
3. Providing quick and prompt responses from instructors to promote active participation and build a sense of online community.
4. Establishing peer support networks or study groups to help students collaborate, share resources, and support each other academically and socially.
5. Organizing virtual events, guest lectures, or webinars related to student interests to engage with experts, scholars, and peers and feel a part of institutional events while not on campus.
