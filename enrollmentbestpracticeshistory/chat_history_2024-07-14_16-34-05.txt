User: What are online student best practices?

Bot: Online students can benefit greatly from a range of support services. They heavily rely on technology, so having 24/7 technical support is crucial. Access to digital libraries, research databases, e-books, and academic journal articles is essential for completing assignments effectively. Online students may also require additional academic support through virtual tutoring services and academic advising sessions for guidance on course selection, study strategies, and academic goals. Creating an interactive learning environment, facilitating communication, encouraging regular interaction among students and instructors, peer support networks, and organizing virtual events are also important practices to engage online students and promote a sense of community.
